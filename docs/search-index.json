Quid, si non modo utilitatem tibi nullam afferet, sed iacturae rei familiaris erunt faciendae, labores suscipiendi, adeundum vitae periculum? Naturalem enim appetitionem, quam vocant o)rmh)n, itemque officium, ipsam etiam virtutem tuentem volunt esse earum rerum, quae secundum naturam sunt. Ego autem existimo, si honestum esse aliquid ostendero, quod sit ipsum vi sua propter seque expetendum, iacere vestra omnia. Quam ob rem turpe putandum est, non dico dolere-nam id quidem est interdum necesse-, sed saxum illud Lemnium clamore Philocteteo funestare, Quod eiulatu, questu, gemitu, fremitibus Resonando mutum flebiles voces refert. Quae dici eadem de ceteris virtutibus possunt, quarum omnium fundamenta vos in voluptate tamquam in aqua ponitis. Cui vero in voluptate summum bonum est, huic omnia sensu, non ratione sunt iudicanda, eaque dicenda optima, quae sint suavissima. Hic homo severus luxuriam ipsam per se reprehendendam non putat, et hercule, Torquate, ut verum loquamur, si summum bonum voluptas est, rectissime non putat. Duo Reges: constructio interrete. In quibus hoc primum est in quo admirer, cur in gravissimis rebus non delectet eos sermo patrius, cum idem fabellas Latinas ad verbum e Graecis expressas non inviti legant. Iam quae corporis sunt, ea nec auctoritatem cum animi partibus, comparandam et cognitionem habent faciliorem. Omnium autem eorum commodorum, quibus non illi plus tribuunt, qui illa bona esse dicunt, quam Zeno, qui negat, longe praestantissimum esse, quod honestum esset atque laudabile. Quibus rebus intellegitur nec timiditatem ignaviamque vituperari nec fortitudinem patientiamque laudari suo nomine, sed illas reici, quia dolorem pariant, has optari, quia voluptatem. Stoici restant, ei quidem non unam aliquam aut alteram rem a nobis, sed totam ad se nostram philosophiam transtulerunt; Quis enim confidit semper sibi illud stabile et firmum permansurum, quod fragile et caducum sit? Nec vero dico eorum metum mortis, qui, quia privari se vitae bonis arbitrentur, aut quia quasdam post mortem formidines extimescant, aut si metuant, ne cum dolore moriantur, idcirco mortem fugiant; Et tamen vide, ne, si ego non intellegam quid Epicurus loquatur, cum Graece, ut videor, luculenter sciam, sit aliqua culpa eius, qui ita loquatur, ut non intellegatur.\nEt hi quidem ita non sola virtute finem bonorum contineri putant, ut rebus tamen omnibus virtutem anteponant; Non elogia monimentorum id significant, velut hoc ad portam: Hunc unum plurimae consentiunt gentes populi primarium fuisse virum. Quin ne bestiae quidem, quas delectationis causa concludimus, cum copiosius alantur, quam si essent liberae, facile patiuntur sese contineri motusque solutos et vagos a natura sibi tributos requirunt. Ea, quae dialectici nunc tradunt et docent, nonne ab illis instituta sunt aut inventa sunt? Huic Epicurus praecentet, si potest, cui e viperino morsu venae viscerum Veneno inbutae taetros cruciatus cient! Sic Epicurus: Philocteta, st! brevis dolor. Primum non saepe, deinde quae est ista relaxatio, cum et praeteriti doloris memoria recens est et futuri atque inpendentis torquet timor? Non enim actionis aut officii ratio impellit ad ea, quae secundum naturam sunt, petenda, sed ab iis et appetitio et actio commovetur. Inest in eadem explicatione naturae insatiabilis quaedam e cognoscendis rebus voluptas,in qua una confectis rebus necessariis vacui negotiis honeste ac liberaliter possimus vivere. Bonum ipsum etiam quid esset, fortasse, si opus fuisset, definisses aut quod esset natura adpetendum aut quod prodesset aut quod iuvaret aut quod liberet modo. In omni enim animante est summum aliquid atque optimum, ut in equis, in canibus, quibus tamen et dolore vacare opus est et valere; Quare istam quoque aggredere tractatam praesertim et ab aliis et a te ipso saepe, ut tibi deesse non possit oratio. Et hi quidem ita non sola virtute finem bonorum contineri putant, ut rebus tamen omnibus virtutem anteponant; Ac tamen, ne cui loco non videatur esse responsum, pauca etiam nunc dicam ad reliquam orationem tuam. Quodsi esset in voluptate summum bonum, ut dicitis, optabile esset maxima in voluptate nullo intervallo interiecto dies noctesque versari, cum omnes sensus dulcedine omni quasi perfusi moverentur.

Sed tamen omne, quod de re bona dilucide dicitur, mihi praeclare dici videtur. Cum enim superiores, e quibus planissime Polemo, secundum naturam vivere summum bonum esse dixissent, his verbis tria significari Stoici dicunt, unum eius modi, vivere adhibentem scientiam earum rerum, quae natura evenirent.

        "content": "ResiSense is a project that aims to provide a cheaper and faster alternative to detecting antibiotic-resistant pathogens via DNA sensing.\nPROBLEM BACKGROUND\nANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE PREVALENCE\nAntibiotic resistance is a growing problem in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared antibiotic resistance as one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development ‚§¥Ô∏è. The misuse and overuse of antibiotics have led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Previously manageable infections resurface as untreatable diseases as the effectiveness of last-resort drugs are compromised, leading to increased mortality rates and healthcare costs. Antibiotic resistance directly caused 1.27 million deaths and contributed to 4.95 million deaths in total in 2019 ‚§¥Ô∏è, and this figure is projected to rise to 10 million by 2050 if no action is taken ‚§¥Ô∏è.\nCURRENT METHODS\nThe current methods for detecting antibiotic-resistant pathogens are expensive and time-consuming, limiting its accessibility and potential utility ‚§µÔ∏è. A cheaper, faster, and simpler technology is needed.\nOUR SOLUTION\nWe are developing a point-of-care test kit, ResiSense, for more efficient diagnosis, using cell-free synthetic biology. This proposed testing system consists of three parts: target gene extraction, rolling circle amplification (RCA) ‚§¥Ô∏è, and signal expression. Bacterial DNA is released following cell lysis before a snippet of the target gene responsible for antibiotic resistance is cut using a pair of restriction enzymes and nickase. Œ¶-29 polymerase aids in releasing the target gene as ss-DNA. This target gene serves as a primer and triggers the formation of peroxidase-mimicking (G-quadruplex) DNAzymes through RCA to cause a color change in the solution, indicating the presence of antibiotic-resistant genes in bacteria. Our aim is to create a versatile, easily programmable system that can detect various antibiotic resistance genes, starting with those related to Klebsiella pneumonia, which is a common intestinal bacterium that showed elevated resistance levels against critical antibiotics ‚§¥Ô∏è.\nEXPECTED RESULTS\nTesting Method Limitations Time Cost (USD) MIC Long incubation time 24h 9.18 PCR Requires specific machines and trained personnel 50m 34.18 Sequencing Requires trained personnel and specilised software 24h 97.52 MALDI-TOF MS Requires expensive equipment and trained personnel 30m 0.1 ResiSense (Projected) Under development 93m 5.22\nOur solution aims to address the problems of lengthy culturing, the need for specilised machines and trained personnel by offering a cheaper, quicker, and simpler technology.

        "content": "üöß Under construction\nINSPIRATION\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has popularised the concept and the use of point-of-care testing kits. Inspired by this, our team is attempting to develop a novel point-of-care testing kit that is versatile to detect different types of antibiotic resistance. We initially discovered a potential tool that might help us in constructing our kit, which is the 8-17 deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes), together with the stem-loops and fluoroprobes-containing oligonucleotides. These DNAzymes are capable of receiving inputs at their stem-loops, which will then expose their catalytic sites, and cause cleavage of the oligonucleotides to produce fluorescence [1]. Using this biological logic gate system, we were planning to utilise the DNAzymes stem-loops to detect resistance genes. However, upon consulting the ideas with our Principal Investigators, we realised that a detection kit that depends on fluorescence-based results is not the ideal choice for constructing a point-of-care diagnostic kit. Thus, we shifted our focus to develop a kit that generates colorimetric results instead.\nBACKGROUND\nANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE\nAntibiotics, used for over a century to treat bacterial infections, are one of the most successful medical interventions. However, antibiotic resistance has increased due to overuse, causing previously manageable diseases to resurface. Many infectious diseases, which were wiped out by antibiotics, have become a more severe problem in recent years.\nIn a study published in 2022, it was estimated that 4.95 millions (95% CI 3.62-6.57 millions) of deaths were associated with bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in 2019, and 1.27 millions of it were caused by bacterial AMR [2]. These figures indicate that deaths due to AMR represent a major global health concern, comparable in scale to leading causes of mortality such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [3].\nOut of the 4.95 millions of bacterial AMR associated deaths, 4.3 millions are occurring in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) [4]. This indicates a necessary step up in LMICs‚Äô infection prevention and control, as well as access to affordable diagnosis. According to the Lancet Series on Antimicrobial Resistance, if interventions are implemented to align infection prevention and control standards in LMICs‚Äô healthcare settings with the standards in high-income countries, we will be able to prevent up to 337,000 AMR associated deaths annually [4].\nThe rise of antibiotic resistant trends is mainly driven by the high selection pressure caused by the increasing use and misuse of antibiotics over the years. Over the past two decades, global antimicrobial use has increased by 46% [3]. The usage of antibiotics to cure infections has actually provided advantages for those bacteria that have resistance, causing the further spread of resistant bacteria since they survive better in the environment compared to the susceptible ones [3].\nIn the natural process, horizontal gene transfer might also occur among species of bacteria. This process enables bacteria to exchange their genetic material, including antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), across diverse species, which greatly facilitates collaboration among bacterial populations in the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) [5]. Moreover, MDR leads to the escalation in severity of the problem. The most evident instance is Superbugs, a strain of bacteria that are resistant to several types of antibiotics, which greatly challenges the treatment process of a bacterial infection.\nOn a larger scope, the problem of AMR causes larger problems than just increased challenge in treating bacterial infection. It also complicates the treatment of chronic kidney disease, diabetes and associated urinary tract and foot infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver cirrhosis, as well as surgical care due to the risk of exposure to resistant infections [3]. In addition, AMR impedes progress towards the global childhood survival rate targeted by the Sustainable Development Goal 3. This is because one third of newborn deaths are caused by infections, and half of these infection-related deaths are specifically attributed to sepsis [3]. Concerningly, the pathogens driving these deadly infections are becoming increasingly resistant to the most widely used antibiotic treatments [3].\nFurthermore, the rise of antimicrobial resistance has diminished the effectiveness of previously useful antimicrobial drugs, causing access to antimicrobials that were previously considered second-line treatments has become increasingly crucial [3]. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) projects a twofold surge in resistance to last-resort antibiotics by 2035 compared to 2005 levels [6].\nIn addressing the problems of antibiotic resistance, the Lancet series in 2024 proposed three goals to be achieved globally by 2030; 10% decrease in deaths from AMR, 20% reduction in inappropriate human antibiotic use, and 30% reduction in inappropriate animal antibiotic use [7]. These goals can only be achieved with optimised surveillance, including diagnosis to prevent the misuse of ineffective antibiotics which only further drive resistance. However, current technologies for diagnosing antibiotic resistance, such as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), require lengthy culturing, while genetic tests like PCR necessitate trained personnel. Additionally, routine bacteriological culture testing is available in only 1.3% of laboratories in sub-Saharan Africa [8]. To counteract the rising trend of antibiotic resistance, and to provide better access to diagnostic kits in low-resource settings, a cheaper, faster, and simpler technology is needed.\nKLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE\nKlebsiella pneumoniae has often been linked to causing pneumonia, especially in people who have alcohol use disorder or diabetes mellitus [9]. It is a gram-negative, encapsulated, and non-motile type of bacterium found in the environment, mainly colonising human mucosal surfaces of the oropharynx and gastrointestinal (GI) tract [9]. Klebsiella pneumoniae infection is best treated with third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, quinolones, or carbapenems [10]. However, over the years, Klebsiella pneumoniae has shown to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) that breaks down and inactivates beta-lactam antibiotics, including cephalosporin, rendering third-generation cephalosporin drugs ineffective for treating Klebsiella pneumoniae infections.\nAdditionally, cases of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae have also been discovered. This thus classifies Klebsiella pneumonia as one of the Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). Similar to beta-lactamase, carbapenem resistance is conferred by the production of the carbapenemase enzyme which is capable of hydrolyzing and disabling the drug molecule [11], [12]. More concerningly, carbapenemases are encoded on plasmids, for instance, as blaKPC and blaNDM-1 [13]. This means that it can be easily transferred between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer, resulting in a more vigorous spread of the resistance [14].\nIn the estimated 1.27 million deaths caused by AMR, Klebsiella pneumoniae was one of the six leading pathogens [2]. In sub-Saharan Africa, Klebsiella pneumoniae contributed to 19.9% deaths caused by AMR and 17.5% of AMR-associated mortality [2]. Other than that, Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of neonatal sepsis in low resource settings, such as in sub-Saharan Africa [3], [15]. Although it is estimated that only 3-5% of all community-acquired pneumonia in Western culture is related to Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, in developing countries such as African countries, for example, community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae accounts for roughly 15% of all pneumonia cases [9].\nIn terms of its resistant variants, resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae commonly causes community-acquired urinary tract infections along with resistant Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus [3]. According to the World Health Organization, Klebsiella pneumoniae showed elevated resistance levels against major antibiotics, compromising the effectiveness of these last-resort drugs and increasing the risk of untreatable infections [6]. This indicates that Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most significant pathogens when it comes to antibiotic resistance. Additionally, the 2024 Lancet series emphasised on the needs for novel strategies to address the burden of ESKAPE pathogens, which includes Klebsiella pneumoniae [4], [13].\nWith this regard, we consider Klebsiella pneumoniae as our starting focus in developing our diagnosis method. With its level of urgency, especially in low-resource settings, performing diagnosis of resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in a simple and low-cost manner will benefit the community for a more effective usage of antibiotics as well as for enhanced surveillance.\nOUR SOLUTION\nWe are developing a point-of-care test kit, ResiSense, for more efficient diagnosis, using cell-free systems. This proposed testing system consists of three parts: target gene extraction, rolling circle amplification (RCA), and signal expression.\nAfter cell lysis releases bacterial DNA, a snippet of the target gene, which is responsible for antibiotic resistance, is cut using a pair of restriction enzymes and nickase. The phi-29 polymerase aids in releasing the target gene as ss-DNA. This target gene serves as a primer and triggers the formation of peroxidase-mimicking DNAzymes through rolling circle amplification (RCA). Finally, the G-quadruplex DNAzymes cause a colour change in the solution, indicating the presence of antibiotic-resistant genes in bacteria.\nAll processes in our detection system are designed to occur in isothermal conditions, specifically in room temperature. Our aim is to create a versatile, easily programmable system that can detect various antibiotic resistance genes, starting with those related to Klebsiella pneumoniae.\nOUR VISION\nAs reported in the 2024 Lancet Series on Antimicrobial Resistance, preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics will depend on accurate and timely diagnosis of bacterial infections [7]. However, the scaling up of diagnostic technologies faces a number of challenges, including technological, economic, and behavioural challenges [7]. Thus, this project is mainly about developing an affordable, simple, yet accurate diagnostic kit, aimed to provide better accessibility to diagnostic technologies in low-resource settings by eliminating the problems of lengthy culturing, the need for specialised machines, and trained personnel.\nAfter successfully running our systems to detect the resistance genes of Klebsiella pneumoniae, we are planning to expand the project to detect resistance genes of other bacterial species, as well as the species itself. We understand that diagnosing resistance is insufficient without the information of species. Thus, in the future, we will adapt the detection system to also recognize and report the bacteria species that cause the infection.\nIn the long run, with the lower cost and decent turnaround time, our technology has the potential to help doctors choose the right antibiotics to prescribe, saving lives that would not be possible to save without access to MALDI-TOF. Our technology also helps prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance by alerting the medical professionals of its existence. Financially, we target to open up a new market that was previously unreachable with the current technologies. Lastly, we aim to create an impact in research by developing a methodology that could be readily adapted to detecting other segments of genes in any organism, helping other researchers develop accessible diagnostic tests based on our platform.\nREFERENCES\n 1.

        "content": "Integrated human practice refers to the collaboration with various parties with aims of furthering our project.\nOVERVIEW\nOur team, Resisense, is deeply committed to addressing the critical needs of our community and the world at large. To secure our project's success, we conducted extensive human practice interviews to understand the intricate details of detecting antibiotic resistance genes and the points of concern of implementing our kits in practice.\nWe are acutely aware that antibiotic resistance is not just a complex issue but also a pressing one. Our human practice research is far from a mere formality but the cornerstone of our probe selection, kit design, target market identification, and education workshop design.\n[Here need an illustration]\nOur integrated human practice consists of 4 steps: literature review and brainstorm, implementation, expert consultations, and project modification. We heavily emphasises the connection of our project design with the actual needs of society. In this regard, we consulted numerous experts to invent a product that provides maximum impact to society and matches the requirements of various stakeholders.\nIt is with sincerity that we say the success of our project is indebted to our human practice interviews. By investing time and effort into these conversations, the invaluable knowledge and broad perspectives we gathered enriched our project greatly, particularly in our wet lab and education events.\nINTERVIEWS\nPROBE VECTOR SELECTION\nPROFESSOR MARGARET IP\nProfessor Ip is the Chairperson of the Department of Microbiology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. She is an expert in Clinical Microbiology and Infection and is a renowned member of various antibiotics-related committees.¬†\nIn the interview with Prof Margaret Ip, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the current situation of antibiotic resistance in Hong Kong and the corresponding detection methods.\nCURRENT METHODS\nProf Ip explained that the most common way to detect antibiotic resistance genes is through DNA sequencing with protein analysis. However, this method is expensive, especially in developing countries. It requires a lab expert and a large machine to analyse.\nSENSITIVITY AND STABILITY\nProf Ip suggested that DNA is more stable and sensitive than detecting proteins or toxins produced by bacteria alone. She recommended that we detect multiple genes in one test for the sake of sensitivity and accuracy due to the occurrence of multiple genes in bacteria.\nIMPLICATIONS\nWe plan to detect related DNA to infer antibiotic resistance in targeted bacteria. Proteins and toxins will be our alternative if the DNA sensing approach does not work in our web lab. As per Prof Ip's emphasis, our point-of-care device should be cheaper and faster than DNA sequencing techniques currently used.¬†\nSCIENCE COMMUNICATION AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT\nDOCTOR HELEN MA\nDoctor Ma is the science education project manager at the Office of University General Education at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and an RTHK television science programme host. She is an experienced science communicator, with a background in Streptococcus pneumoniae antibiotic resistance research in her post-graduate degree.\nIn the interview with Dr Ma, we consulted her on the public's attitude towards antibiotics and the best practices to effective science communication.\nGENERAL PUBLIC'S UNDERSTANDING\nDr Ma expressed that while the general public is getting more educated on the issue of antibiotic resistance, not all people will take action to impede the spread of resistance. For instance, since medicine is often considered \"harmful\" and damaging to the body in the view of Hong Kong people, and antibiotics are only administered when the symptoms are severe, people often choose not to complete their antibiotic prescription. The concept of antibiotic resistance is vague and distant to the general public, giving them low motivation to take the right action.\nEFFECTIVE SCIENCE COMMUNICATION\nDr Ma suggested that when describing abstract ideas to people, especially the older generation, we need to emphasise how it will directly affect them instead of how it works. For instance, instead of explaining how the leak of antibiotics leads to the development of resistance, we should directly tell them that their medicine will not work next time if they don‚Äôt complete their prescription and that doctors will eventually run out of effective medication. It is more effective to convince them by illustrating how they will be directly affected instead of lecturing them on the mechanisms and causal relationships.\nPOINT-OF-CARE KIT DESIGN\nPROFESSOR STEPHEN TSUI\nProfessor Tsui is a renowned expert in the field of Biomedical Sciences and the director of the Hong Kong Bioinformatics Centre and the Centre for Microbial Genomics and Proteomics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\nIn the interview with Prof Tsui, we discussed the feasibility and efficiency of our point-of-care (POC) kit and analysed the current market.\nSPECIFICITY AND ACCURACY\nProf Tsui pointed out that impurities could lead to significant problems in the accuracy and sensitivity of our RCA step. He suggested that we implement purification steps and controls in our test to improve the reliability of the results.\nTARGETED GROUP\nProf Tsui suggested that our project design tends to be qualitative, rather than quantitative, like MIC. He explained that a qualitative approach might not be ideal for clinical use, as doctors may be unable to determine the result and take appropriate actions based on it. Therefore, he recommended that we decide on how to show the colorimetric result in the last step, such as using a laptop with the POC device to detect the color change quantitatively, or employ a COVID RAT-like approach.\nMARKET\nProf Tsui pointed out that the most popular and mature approaches to detect antibiotic-resistant genes nowadays in developed countries include MIC, DNA sequencing, and real-time PCR plus single-point mutation enzymes. However, these techniques are not common in developing countries, which means we could be more competitive if we target them.\nIMPLICATIONS\nProf Tsui's advice will help us improve the reliability and accuracy of our POC kit. We will consider his suggestions on employing a qualitative approach and focusing on a target group to make our product more competitive in the market.\nANTIBIOTIC USE IN HOSPITALS AND PUBLIC AWARENESS\nDOCTOR PIERRE CHAN\nDoctor Pierre Chan is a medical practitioner and a former legislative counsellor seated as the representative for the medical functional constituency in Hong Kong.\nIn our discussion with Dr Chan, we gained insights into the use of antibiotics in hospitals and public awareness of antibiotics.\nHOSPITAL PROCEDURE\nDr Chan explained that in severe cases, doctors usually use empirical antibiotics based on international guidelines to save lives instead of finding the most appropriate drugs. However, in non-severe cases, doctors check the type of bacteria involved in the infection. He also mentioned that several samples such as urine, blood, and stool are collected from patients, but only 2-3 samples usually show positive results. It is crucial to consider the type of samples collected for analysis. Furthermore, hospitals usually do not recheck the results due to time and manpower constraints, and a full analysis takes 1-2 days.\nPUBLIC AWARENESS\nDr Chan believes that the problem of antibiotic resistance is more prevalent in the community than in hospitals. He cited the misuse of antibiotics in the agricultural industry as an example of how the abuse of these drugs is not regulated. Although public awareness about antibiotics is not low in Hong Kong, Dr Chan pointed out that some people buy restricted drugs, including antibiotics, without a doctor's prescription. Our discussion highlighted the need for educational events to address this issue. It is essential to consider different approaches to education to ensure that the public is well-informed about the importance of responsible use of antibiotics.\nIMPLICATIONS\nOur discussion with Dr Chan shed light on the use of antibiotics in hospitals and the public awareness about antibiotics. We will focus our point-of-care kit for screening speed. We will also consider his insights while developing our educational events to ensure that the public is well-informed about the importance of responsible use of antibiotics.\nBIOTECHNOLOGY EDUCATION IN LOCAL SECONDARY SCHOOLS\nDR VICTOR LAU\nDoctor Victor Lau is the assistant dean of the Department of Curriculum and Instruction at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a consultant for the science education curriculum in Hong Kong.\nIn our discussion with Dr Lau, we gained insights in the contemporary shortcomings of biotechnology education in local secondary schools.\nBIOTECH DEVELOPMENT IN LOCAL SECONDARY SCHOOLS\nAs local students, we have experienced Hong Kong‚Äôs science education and its flaws. Biotechnology is currently an elective topic in the biology curriculum, covering fundamental theories like PCR and gel electrophoresis. However, as mentioned by Dr Lau, it is not cost-efficient for a secondary school to invest in a complete set of biotechnology lab equipment solely for teaching a few chapters. Targeting this problem, Hong Kong Amgen Biotech Experience (ABEHK), an organization co-directed by Dr Lau, is supporting local schools by renting out equipment like thermocyclers and pipettes to schools and sending student ambassadors to provide hands-on experience to secondary school students, similar to typical iGEM secondary school experience workshops.\nEDUCATION ON ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE\nDr Lau suggested focusing more on antibiotic resistance in our education workshops. He pointed out many misconceptions on this matter, not only among students but also among the general public. The most common one is that resistant bacteria only come from the use of antibiotics. He also highlighted a trend of medical malpractice where local clinics are not giving the full antibiotic dose to cut costs, leading to resistant bacteria development. Although the government has distributed posters and leaflets on this topic, the message is not well-absorbed. Dr Lau suggested using simple interactive models assembled with simple stationery like paper clips and magnets to explain relevant concepts to the public in an interactive way over a verbal-only approach.\nIMPLICATIONS\nWe pointed out that one of the most common issues secondary school students face is that they need to troubleshoot experiments. Workshops like those provided by ABE allow students to understand better the theory and, hence, the errors that led to their failures. After learning about ABE and its mission, we planned to build upon their workshops and design one of our own, specifically with material to teach students how to troubleshoot."

        "title": "Proof of Concept",
        "content": "üöß Under construction\nAs described in our project description, we are developing a point-of-care test kit, ResiSense, for the screening of antibiotic resistance genes. Our proposed detection system consists of three parts: target gene extraction, rolling circle amplification (RCA), and signal expression. This page describes how we designed the experimental settings to prove the concept that we proposed, and the rationale behind those designs. Due to safety concerns, all of our experiments are carried out using Escherichia coli (E. coli) as the chassis instead of the actual pathogenic resistant bacteria.\nPLASMID CONSTRUCTION\nFor proof of concept purposes, we constructed a pSB1C3-KPC-2-surrogate plasmid that carries a short snippet of the KPC-2 gene by assembling the KPC-2-surrogate gene fragment [PARTS NO] with pSB1C3 backbone using the RFC 10 BioBricks assembly standard [1]. First, we performed PCR to the KPC-2 surrogate gene fragment to amplify its quantity. The KPC-2-surrogate is designed to be compatible with RFC[10], thus, both the KPC-2-surrogate PCR product and pSB1C3 backbone (from Interlab 2018 Test Device 5, Distribution Kit 2024 [PARTS NO]) were cut using EcoRI and PstI (Anza, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). This ligation product was then cloned with chemically competent DH5…ë E. coli cells and extracted using the miniprep kit (iNtRON Biotechnology). The cloned plasmid was then sent for sequencing (BGI Genomics) and the result was satisfactory.\nROLLING CIRCLE AMPLIFICATION (RCA) TEMPLATE CONSTRUCTION\nTo facilitate the RCA process, we have constructed a circularised third-generation (v3) RCA template [PARTS NO] with the following sequence:\n[TK]\nThe linear oligonucleotide strand was synthesised by IDT and assembled into circular ssDNA form using IDT-synthesised scaffold (5‚Äô-gccaccgcggtctcacgggt-3‚Äô) and T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), and thus, treated with Exonuclease I and III (Thermo Fisher Scientific and Takara Bio) to remove the remaining scaffold.\nCELL LYSIS\nPrior to the detection system, the collected bacterial sample must be lysed to release its bacterial DNA. In this proof of concept stage, we choose to lyse the cells using SDS. Using SDS to lyse bacterial cells has been an established procedure, which is used in the extraction of plasmids from bacteria using miniprep kits [2], SDS lysis could serve as a benchmark for lysis efficiency and plasmid yield when compared to other lysis methods or buffer compositions. The proof of our methodology in lysing the cells using SDS can be viewed in our results page.\nTARGET GENE EXTRACTION\nAfter cell lysis, a snippet of the target gene, which is responsible for antibiotic resistance, is cut using a restriction enzyme and a nickase. The nickase is used to cut the 3‚Äô side of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), while a restriction enzyme cuts the 5‚Äô side of the gene snippet. The restriction enzyme and nickase used to digest the plasmid in the proof of concept stage are HhaI and Nt.BsmAI (New England Biolabs) respectively.\nFollowing the digestion, phi29 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs and Beyotime Biotechnology) releases a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) through linear strand displacement amplification (LSDA). Phi-29 binds to the nicked 5‚Äô end of the gene, which is the pSB1C3-KPC-2-surrogate in this proof of concept, and then amplifies one strand of the plasmid up to the HhaI cutting site. This process is expected to amplify a 32 nt ssDNA from the pSB1C3-KPC-2-surrogate plasmid, which will serve as the primer for the following steps, along with 724 and 534 nt ssDNA strands as the side products of this LSDA process.\nAn experiment has also been conducted to test this process, and the results are shown here.\nROLLING CIRCLE AMPLIFICATION (RCA)\nThe circularised RCA template consists of a primer binding site, where the 32 nt ssDNA from the previous step will bind to. Upon this binding, phi-29 DNA polymerase will start to add nucleotides following the primer 3‚Äô-end, according to sequences complementary to the RCA template [3]. During this step, we expect cells that do not carry KPC-2 gene will not produce complementary primer, thus, will not trigger the RCA process.\nAfter completing its first round along the RCA template, phi-29 will continue to replicate the RCA template while displacing the complementary strands that it has formed during its previous round [4]. By including the complementary strand of our peroxidase-mimicking G-quadruplex DNAzyme into the RCA template, the RCA process is expected to generate repeats of the G-quadruplex DNAzyme upon the primer binding.\nThe RCA template also includes the recognition site of the Nt.BsmAI nicking endonuclease. Without Nt.BsmAI, this RCA process will generate a long continuous strand that consists of repeats of the RCA template. However, with the addition of Nt.BsmAI, the phi-29-produced strands will be nicked by the nickase prior to its displacement, producing shorter products out of the amplification process. This aims to increase the detection sensitivity by mediating exponential RCA [5].\nTo test the RCA reactions and to eliminate interfering factors, we have also conducted the RCA experiments with synthetic RCA primer from IDT. We tested several conditions for the RCA process and the results can be viewed here.\nSIGNAL EXPRESSION\nThe previous step of the system generates G-quadruplex structures that act as peroxidase-mimicking DNAzymes. The products from RCA are then set up into a reaction consisting of Hemin, TMB, and H2O2. If the RCA process was triggered, G-quadruplex DNAzyme will be formed, and thus produce a colour change of the reaction due to the oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to TMB+. The positive reaction is hence indicated by a blue colour while the negative reaction does not change colour from transparent.\nIt is understood that the working mechanism of the DNAzyme involves the attachment of Hemin to the G-quadruplex structure, a guanine-rich DNA sequence stabilised by hydrogen bonds, to produce a stable complex [6]. Hemin's iron has the ability to move electrons around to catalyse the conversion of TMB to TMB+ [6].\nTo confirm the process of the G-quadruplex DNAzyme reaction, we have also acquired an IDT-synthesised DNA [PARTS NO] that will fold into a G-quadruplex structure. All of the experiment results can be found here.\nREMARKS\nAll processes in our detection system are aimed to be completed in isothermal conditions, specifically in room temperature. However, in the proof of concept stage, we mostly performed our experiments in the suggested optimum temperatures of the enzyme. Although we confirmed that most of the reactions can be carried out at 37¬∞C or lower, further verification is required to assess its performance fully at room temperature.\nREFERENCES\n 1. \"Help:Standards/Assembly/RFC10\", Registry of Standard Biological Parts, https://parts.igem.org/Help:Standards/Assembly/RFC10 (accessed Sep. 24, 2024).\n 2. \"DNA-spinTM Plasmid DNA Purification Kit\", iNtRON Biotechnology, https://intronbio.com:6001/intronbioen/product/product_view.php?PRDT_ID=1 (accessed Sep. 24, 2024).\n 3.
