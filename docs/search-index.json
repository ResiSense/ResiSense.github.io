Inspired by this, our team is attempting to develop a novel point-of-care testing kit that can detect different antibiotic resistance types in a versatile manner. We initially identified a potential tool that might help us construct our kit: the 8-17 deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes), together with the stem-loop- and fluoroprobe-containing oligonucleotides. These DNAzymes can receive inputs at their stem-loops, which will then expose their catalytic sites and cause cleavage of the oligonucleotides to produce fluorescence [1]. Using this biological logic gate system, we planned to utilise the DNAzymes stem-loops to detect resistance genes.\nHowever, upon consulting the ideas with our PIs and PoC experts, we realised that a detection kit that depends on fluorescence-based results is not the ideal choice for constructing a point-of-care diagnostic kit. Thus, we shifted our focus towards developing a kit that generates colourimetric results instead.\nPROBLEM BACKGROUND\nANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE\nAntibiotics, used for over a century to treat bacterial infections, are among the most successful medical interventions. However, antibiotic resistance has increased due to overuse, causing previously manageable diseases to resurface. Many infectious diseases that antibiotics used to be effective against have become more severe problems in recent years. \nCURRENT DEATH TOLL AND FUTURE PROJECTIONS\nIn a study published in 2022, it was estimated that 4.95 million (95% CI 3.62-6.57 million) deaths were associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in 2019, with 1.27 million of them attributed to bacterial AMR [2]. These figures indicate that deaths due to AMR represent a major global health concern, comparable in scale to leading causes of mortality such as ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [3]. \nOut of the 4.95 million AMR-associated deaths, a staggering 4.3 million are occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [4]. This stark disparity underscores the urgent need to enhance infection prevention and control and to improve access to affordable diagnoses in these regions. The Lancet Series on Antimicrobial Resistance suggests that aligning infection prevention and control standards in LMICs' healthcare settings with those in high-income countries could prevent up to 337,000 AMR-associated deaths annually [4].\nLEADING CAUSES OF AMR\nThe rise of antibiotic resistance is primarily fuelled by the high selective pressure caused by the increasing use and misuse of antibiotics over the years. In the past two decades, global antimicrobial use has increased by 46% [3]. The overuse of antibiotics provides an advantage for resistant bacteria, causing them to proliferate since they survive better in the environment than their susceptible competitors [3]. \nIn nature, horizontal gene transfer occurs among species of bacteria. This process enables bacteria to exchange their genetic material, including antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), often across multiple species, greatly facilitating collaboration among bacterial populations in the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) [5]. Obviously, MDR leads to escalations in the severity of the problem, the most evident of which being superbugs, which are strains of bacteria resistant to several types of antibiotics. This phenomenon dramatically challenges the treatment process of a bacterial infection. \nCONCERNING IMPLICATIONS\nIn a broader scope, AMR causes problems beyond the increased challenge of treating bacterial infection. It also complicates the treatment of chronic kidney disease, diabetes and associated urinary tract and foot infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver cirrhosis, as well as surgical care due to the risk of exposure to resistant infections [3]. In addition, AMR impedes progress towards the global childhood survival rate targeted by Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being. This is because one-third of newborn deaths are caused by infections, with half of these infection-related deaths attributed explicitly to sepsis [3]. Worryingly, the pathogens driving these deadly infections are becoming increasingly resistant to the most widely used antibiotic treatments [3]. \nFurthermore, the rise of antimicrobial resistance has diminished the effectiveness of previously useful antimicrobial drugs, causing access to antimicrobials previously considered second-line to become increasingly crucial [3]. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) projects a twofold surge in resistance to last-resort antibiotics from 2005 to 2035 based on current trends [6].\nFUTURE OUTLOOK\nIn addressing the problems of antibiotic resistance, the Lancet series, in 2024, proposed three goals to be achieved globally by 2030: a 10% decrease in deaths from AMR, a 20% reduction in inappropriate human antibiotic use, and a 30% reduction of that in animals [7]. These goals can only be achieved with optimised global surveillance, including fast and accurate diagnoses to prevent the misuse of ineffective antibiotics, which only furthers resistance prevalence.\nHowever, current technologies for diagnosing antibiotic resistance, such as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), require lengthy culturing, while genetic tests like PCR necessitate trained personnel. Additionally, routine bacteriological culture testing is available in only 1.3% of laboratories in sub-Saharan Africa [8]. To counteract the rising trend of antibiotic resistance and to provide better access to diagnostic kits in low-resource settings, a cheaper, faster, and simpler technology is needed.\nKLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE\nANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE\nKlebsiella pneumoniae is often cited as a common cause of pneumonia [9]. It is a gram-negative, encapsulated, and non-motile bacterium found in the environment, mainly colonising human mucosal surfaces of the oropharynx and gastrointestinal (GI) tract [9]. Klebsiella pneumoniae infection is best treated with third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, quinolones, or carbapenems [10]. However, over the years, Klebsiella pneumoniae has been shown to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) that breaks down and deactivates beta-lactam antibiotics, including cephalosporin, rendering third-generation cephalosporin drugs ineffective for treating Klebsiella pneumoniae infections. \nAdditionally, cases of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae have also been discovered. This thus classifies Klebsiella pneumoniae as one of the carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). Similar to beta-lactamase, carbapenem resistance is conferred by producing carbapenemase capable of hydrolysing and neutralising the drug molecule [11], [12]. Notably, carbapenemases are encoded on plasmids such as blaKPC and blaNDM-1 [13]. This means it can be easily transferred between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer, resulting in a more vigorous spread of the resistance [14]. \nURGENCY FOR DETECTION\nIn terms of its resistant variants, resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae commonly causes community-acquired urinary tract infections along with resistant Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus [3]. According to the World Health Organisation, Klebsiella pneumoniae showed elevated resistance levels against major antibiotics, compromising the effectiveness of these last-resort drugs and increasing the risk of untreatable infections [6]. This indicates that Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most significant pathogens regarding antibiotic resistance. Additionally, the 2024 Lancet series emphasised the need for novel strategies to address the burden of ESKAPE pathogens, which includes Klebsiella pneumoniae [4], [13].\nLOW-RESOURCE SETTINGS\nAmong the estimated 1.27 million deaths caused by AMR, Klebsiella pneumoniae was one of the six leading contributing pathogens [2]. In sub-Saharan Africa, Klebsiella pneumoniae contributed to 19.9% of deaths caused by AMR and 17.5% of AMR-associated mortality [2]. Other than that, Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of neonatal sepsis in low-resource settings, such as in sub-Saharan Africa [3], [15]. Although it is estimated that only 3-5% of all community-acquired pneumonia in Western culture is related to Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, in developing countries such as African countries, for example, community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae accounts for roughly 15% of all pneumonia cases [9].\nWith this regard, we consider Klebsiella pneumoniae as our starting focus in developing our diagnosis method. With its level of urgency, especially in low-resource settings, performing diagnosis of resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in a simple and low-cost manner will benefit the community for more effective usage of antibiotics and enhanced surveillance.\nOUR SOLUTION\nWe are developing a point-of-care test kit, ResiSense, for more efficient screening using cell-free systems. This proposed testing system consists of target gene extraction, rolling circle amplification (RCA), and signal expression. \nMECHANISM OF ACTION\nAfter cell lysis releases bacterial DNA, a snippet of the target gene responsible for antibiotic resistance is cut using a pair of restriction enzymes and nickase. The Φ-29 polymerase aids in releasing the target gene as ss-DNA. This target gene serves as a primer and triggers the formation of peroxidase-mimicking DNAzymes, G-quadruplex through rolling circle amplification (RCA). Finally, the G-quadruplex DNAzymes cause an observable colour change in the solution, indicating the presence of antibiotic-resistant genes in bacteria.\nAll processes in our detection system are designed to occur in isothermal conditions, specifically at room temperature, and do not require dedicated, large on-site hardware. Our aim is to create a versatile, easily programmable system that can adapt to various settings and detect a wide range of antibiotic resistance genes, starting with those related to Klebsiella pneumoniae.\nEXPLAINER VIDEO\nPlease feel free to watch this video for an animated explanation of our project.

KPCs are among the most widespread carbapenemases, with blaKPC-2 as China's most prevalent gene variant [17], [18]. Also, the Centre for Health and Protection of Hong Kong has reported 2118 cases of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection in 2023, with approximately 111 cases exhibiting extended-spectrum β-lactamase positive (ESBL+) phenotype [19]. Hence, we believe that due to the prevalence of KPC in the worldwide and regional context, there is a definite need for a test kit for detecting blaKPC-2 from Klebsiella pneumoniae.\nOUR VISION\nAs reported in the 2024 Lancet Series on Antimicrobial Resistance, preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics will depend on accurate and timely diagnosis of bacterial infections [7]. However, the scaling up of diagnostic technologies faces numerous challenges, including technological, economic, and behavioural difficulties [7]. Thus, this project is mainly about developing an affordable, simple, yet accurate diagnostic kit to provide better accessibility to diagnostic technologies in low-resource settings by eliminating the problems of lengthy culturing, the need for specialised machines, and trained personnel.\nAfter successfully running our systems to detect the resistance genes of Klebsiella pneumoniae, we plan to expand the project to detect resistance genes of other bacterial species in addition to identifying the species itself. We understand that diagnosing resistance is insufficient without information on the species. Thus, in the future, we will also adapt the detection system to recognise and report the bacteria species that cause the infection. \nIn the long run, with the lower cost and decent turnaround time, our technology has the potential to help doctors choose the right antibiotics to prescribe, thereby saving lives that would otherwise be lost without access to MALDI-TOF. Our technology also helps prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance by alerting medical professionals of its existence. Financially, we target to open up a new market that was previously unreachable with the current technologies. Lastly, we aim to create an impact in research by developing a methodology that could be readily adapted to detecting other segments of genes in any organism, helping other researchers develop accessible diagnostic tests based on our platform.\nREFERENCES\n 1.

        "content": "Integrated human practices refer to the collaborations with various parties with aims of furthering our project.\nOVERVIEW\nOur team, Resisense, is deeply committed to addressing the critical needs of our community and the world at large. To secure our project's success, we conducted extensive human practice interviews to understand the intricate details of detecting antibiotic resistance genes and the points of concern of implementing our kits in practice.\nIt is with sincerity that we say the success of our project is indebted to our human practice interviews. By investing time and effort into these conversations, the invaluable knowledge and broad perspectives we gathered enriched our project greatly, particularly in our wet lab and education events.\nCORNERSTONES\nWe are acutely aware that antibiotic resistance is not just a complex issue but also a pressing one. Our human practice research is far from a mere formality but the cornerstone of our probe selection, kit design, market analysis, and outreaching education.\nINTEGRATION CYCLE\nOur integrated human practice consists of 4 steps: literature review and brainstorm, implementation, expert consultations, and project modification. We heavily emphasises the connection of our project design with the actual needs of society. In this regard, we consulted numerous experts to invent a product that provides maximum impact to society and matches the requirements of various stakeholders.\nTIMELINE\nINTERVIEWS\nPRELIMINARY PROJECT DESIGN\nPROFESSOR KAREN TAM\nProfessor Tam is a research assistant professor in the chemistry department at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. She has extensive experience in functionalising biocompatible nanomaterials with theranostic agents for diagnosis and therapy, as well as in developing nano-devices for bio-analytics, computing, and other biological applications.\nDNAZYME FEASIBILITY\nIn the consultation with Prof Tam, we presented our initial design for discussion on its feasibility. Our original idea involved using DNA-cleaving DNAzyme that emits fluorescence upon binding to the targeted antibiotic-resistance gene. However, Prof Tam pointed out that the DNA-cleaving DNAzyme binding is not as specific as we had assumed, and its working temperature does not align with our goal of creating a point-of-care device.\nPROJECT MODIFICATION\nAs a result of this meeting, we have made significant changes to our project's mechanism. We realised our initial approach was overly optimistic regarding the biochemical reaction involved. Her opinion prompted us to modify the DNA sensing method by employing a specific enzyme and using G-quadruplex DNAzyme to indicate the presence of the targeted gene through a colour change in the later step.\nCRUX OF SCIENCE COMMUNICATION\nDOCTOR HELEN MA\nDoctor Ma is the science education project manager at the Office of University General Education at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and an RTHK television science programme host. She is an experienced science communicator, with a background in Streptococcus pneumoniae antibiotic resistance research in her post-graduate degree.\nGENERAL PUBLIC'S UNDERSTANDING\nDr Ma expressed that while the general public is getting more educated on the issue of antibiotic resistance, not all people will take action to impede the spread of resistance. For instance, since medicine is often considered \"harmful\" and damaging to the body in the view of Hong Kong people, and antibiotics are only administered when the symptoms are severe, people often choose not to complete their antibiotic prescription. The concept of antibiotic resistance is vague and distant to the general public, giving them low motivation to take the right action.\nEFFECTIVE SCIENCE COMMUNICATION\nWe also consulted her on the best practices to effective science communication. Dr Ma suggested that when describing abstract ideas to people, especially the older generation, we need to emphasise how it will directly affect them instead of how it works. For instance, instead of explaining how the leak of antibiotics leads to the development of resistance, we should directly tell them that their medicine will not work next time if they don’t complete their prescription and that doctors will eventually run out of effective medication. It is more effective to convince them by illustrating how they will be directly affected instead of lecturing them on the mechanisms and causal relationships.\nPROJECT MODIFICATION\nHer precious opinion shed light on our education work. She pointed out how the public misunderstands antibiotics, leading to their misuse and abuse. We thus aimed our workshops towards offering correct information on antibiotics and introducing them to raise public awareness. Her opinion was taken into great consideration when designing our CUHK art fair game.\nPROBE VECTOR SELECTION\nPROFESSOR MARGARET IP\nProfessor Ip is the Chairperson of the Department of Microbiology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. She is an expert in Clinical Microbiology and Infection and is a renowned member of various antibiotics-related committees. \nMARKET ANALYSIS\nIn the interview with Prof Margaret Ip, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the current situation of antibiotic resistance in Hong Kong and the corresponding detection methods. Prof Ip explained that the most common way to detect antibiotic resistance genes is through DNA sequencing with protein analysis. However, this method is expensive, especially in developing countries. It requires a lab expert and a large machine to analyse.\nPROBE CHARACTERISTICS\nProf Ip suggested that DNA is more stable and sensitive than detecting proteins or toxins produced by bacteria alone. She recommended that we detect multiple genes in one test for the sake of sensitivity and accuracy due to the occurrence of multiple genes in bacteria. We plan to detect related DNA to infer antibiotic resistance in targeted bacteria. Proteins and toxins will be our alternative if the DNA sensing approach does not work in our web lab. As per Prof Ip's emphasis, our point-of-care device should be cheaper and faster than DNA sequencing techniques currently used. \nPROJECT MODIFICATION\nDue to the relative stability of DNA molecules compared to protein, we confirmed that we have to detect the desired antibiotic-resistant gene instead of protein and toxin. Before the interview, our team reviewed various DNA sensing methods, including Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA). This interview led us to focus on DNA molecules to increase sensitivity and effectiveness. Following this interview, we confirmed we would employ RCA as our primary detection method. \nPOINT-OF-CARE KIT DESIGN\nPROFESSOR STEPHEN TSUI\nProfessor Tsui is a renowned expert in the field of Biomedical Sciences and the director of the Hong Kong Bioinformatics Centre and the Centre for Microbial Genomics and Proteomics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\nDEVICE RELIABILITY\nDuring our conversation, Prof Tsui provided valuable insights on our project design and future goals, highlighting some key points we had overlooked, such as the issue of specificity and accuracy, including false positive/negative problems and purification issues. He suggested that impurities could lead to significant problems in the accuracy and sensitivity of our RCA step. To address these issues, Prof Tsui recommended some purification steps and implementing controls in our test to improve the reliability of the results.\nTARGETED GROUP\nProf Tsui also shared his precious opinions on our targeted group, pointing out that the most popular and mature approaches to detect antibiotic-resistant genes nowadays in developed countries include MIC, DNA sequencing, real-time PCR, and single-point mutation enzymes. However, these techniques are uncommon in developing countries, so we could be more competitive if we target them.\nRESULTS DISPLAY AND VERIFICATION\nAdditionally, Prof Tsui suggested that our project design tends to be qualitative rather than quantitative, like MIC. He explained that a qualitative approach might not be ideal for clinical use, as doctors may need help determining the result and taking appropriate actions based on it. Therefore, he recommended that we decide how to show a colourimetric result in the last step, such as coupling a digital technology with the POC device to detect the colour change or a COVID-RAT-like approach of showing two lines. (See Our Solution)\nPROJECT MODIFICATION\nProf Tsui's experience provided imperative insight into the results display and our proposed hardware design for point-of-care kits. We designed a colourimetric result display in the final step using G-quadruplex DNAzyme, targeting a similar approach to the COVID-19 rapid test kit. We decided to provide a qualitative result, indicating only \"yes\" or \"no\" for a more straightforward interpretation of the result. Suggestions from Prof Tsui also enabled our team to arrange a purification step in the test kit to prevent the residue from the previous steps from affecting the next step.\nFRONTLINER'S PERSPECTIVE\nDOCTOR PIERRE CHAN\nDoctor Pierre Chan is a medical practitioner and a former legislative counsellor seated as the representative for the medical functional constituency in Hong Kong.\nHOSPITAL PROCEDURE\nDr Chan explained that in severe cases, doctors usually use empirical antibiotics based on international guidelines to save lives instead of finding the most appropriate drugs. However, in non-severe cases, doctors check the type of bacteria involved in the infection. He also mentioned that several samples such as urine, blood, and stool are collected from patients, but only 2-3 samples usually show positive results. It is crucial to consider the type of samples collected for analysis. Furthermore, hospitals usually do not recheck the results due to time and manpower constraints, and a full analysis takes 1-2 days.\nPUBLIC AWARENESS\nDr Chan believes that the problem of antibiotic resistance is more prevalent in the community than in hospitals. He cited the misuse of antibiotics in the agricultural industry as an example of how the abuse of these drugs is not regulated. Although public awareness about antibiotics is not low in Hong Kong, Dr Chan pointed out that some people buy restricted drugs, including antibiotics, without a doctor's prescription. Our discussion highlighted the need for educational events to address this issue. It is essential to consider different approaches to education to ensure that the public is well-informed about the importance of responsible use of antibiotics.\nPROJECT MODIFICATION\nOur discussion with Dr Chan shed light on the use of antibiotics in hospitals and the public awareness about antibiotics. We will focus our point-of-care kit for screening speed. We will also consider his insights while developing our educational events to ensure that the public is well-informed about the importance of responsible use of antibiotics.\nBIOTECHNOLOGY EDUCATION IN LOCAL SECONDARY SCHOOLS\nDR VICTOR LAU\nDoctor Victor Lau is the assistant dean of the Department of Curriculum and Instruction at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a consultant for the science education curriculum in Hong Kong.\nBIOTECH DEVELOPMENT IN LOCAL SECONDARY SCHOOLS\nAs local students, we have experienced Hong Kong’s science education and its flaws. Biotechnology is currently an elective topic in the biology curriculum, covering fundamental theories like PCR and gel electrophoresis. However, as mentioned by Dr Lau, it is not cost-efficient for a secondary school to invest in a complete set of biotechnology lab equipment solely for teaching a few chapters. Targeting this problem, Hong Kong Amgen Biotech Experience (ABEHK), an organisation co-directed by Dr Lau, is supporting local schools by renting out equipment like thermocyclers and pipettes to schools and sending student ambassadors to provide hands-on experience to secondary school students, similar to typical iGEM secondary school experience workshops.\nEDUCATION ON ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE\nDr Lau suggested focusing more on antibiotic resistance in our education workshops. He pointed out many misconceptions on this matter, not only among students but also among the general public. The most common one is that resistant bacteria only come from the use of antibiotics. He also highlighted a trend of medical malpractice where local clinics are not giving the full antibiotic dose to cut costs, leading to resistant bacteria development. Although the government has distributed posters and leaflets on this topic, the message is not well-absorbed. Dr Lau suggested using simple interactive models assembled with simple stationery like paper clips and magnets to explain relevant concepts to the public in an interactive way over a verbal-only approach.\nPROJECT MODIFICATION\nWe pointed out that one of the most common issues secondary school students face is that they need to troubleshoot experiments. Workshops like those provided by ABE allow students to understand better the theory and, hence, the errors that led to their failures. After learning about ABE and its mission, we planned to build upon their workshops and design one of our own, specifically with material to teach students how to troubleshoot.\nINTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES\nDR EDMOND MA\nDoctor Edmond Ma is the AMR consultant for the Infection Control Branch at the Centre for Health Protection of Hong Kong.\nGLOBAL AMR MONITORING\nDuring our interview, Dr Ma introduced us to the ever-updating Bacterial Priority Pathogen List (BPPL) published by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Every year, the WHO refines the list by highlighting bacteria that can resist antibiotics and categorises them into three groups according to their threat level. The list aims to notify doctors of the appropriate treatment that should be taken for cure while also projecting a trend of emerging antibiotic resistance for researchers for reference when developing new ways to combat the bacteria. Meanwhile, the WHO also provides guidelines for the use of antibiotics in the form of Antimicrobial Stewardship Programmes (ASPs). This serves as an education for doctors and health professionals not to abuse antibiotics and antimicrobial medicines, as the overuse of such drugs will accelerate the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria.\nAMR OUTSIDE HOSPITALS\nThe abuse of antibiotics can also happen outside of the typical health workplaces. As Dr Ma mentioned, wastes containing antibiotics might be released from various sources, such as farms that use antibiotics as growth promoters for crops and livestock. When these contaminants enter natural rivers or seep into nearby soils, the local bacteria will be exposed to antibiotics unintentionally. While antibiotics might kill some bacteria, such action will only facilitate the emergence of antibiotic resistance as the bacteria attempt to survive.\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR PROJECT\nOn the design of a point-of-care antibiotic resistance detection kit, Dr Ma agreed that it could help safeguard doctors and patients in a remote or private clinic setting, especially when the patient is in the early stages of infection where only broad symptoms are shown without a clear indication of the type of infectious bacteria. On the other hand, Dr Ma questioned whether a false positive would be detected when the patient is a mere carrier of the resistant bacteria, as a concrete connection between the detected gene and the bacteria causing the infection has yet to be established. It is suggested that an analysis of the rate of carriers of a particular bacteria in the general public should be conducted to estimate the kit's accuracy.\nUSER EXPERIENCE\nOther than that, Dr Ma commented on a few aspects that should be considered when designing a testing kit, one of which is the user experience. A well-designed kit should minimise the suffering of patients during use, including relatively low or no aftermath, such as nausea or aching of body parts after use and pain during sample extraction. Regarding patient samples, Dr Ma also noted that the sample type should be specific to the illness, as a disease-causing bacteria in one body part might be relatively harmless in other locations. For example, a bacteria might induce coughing when it is present in the lungs while having no effect when it enters the intestines, so the sample taken should be products from the respiratory system, such as phlegm, rather than excrements from the digestive system as a presence of the bacteria in such samples can not prove that that causes the coughing.\nPROJECT MODIFICATION\nAfter the interview with Dr Ma, we understood that multiple countries are working on curbing the dissemination of antibiotic resistance, and many low- and middle-income countries are facing the consequences. Dr Ma pointed out that many doctors use so-called big-gun antibiotics for suspected bacterial infections before knowing the MIC result. Besides, he mentioned that many developing countries cannot afford the exorbitantly expensive PCR machine for AMR checking. Therefore, we can have a place in the market to provide cheap and fast testing methods to fill in the gap. This interview gave us a new direction for selecting our target market and our aimed application. "

        "title": "Proof of Concept",
        "content": "As described in our Project Description, we are developing a point-of-care test kit, ResiSense, to screen antibiotic resistance genes. Our proposed detection system consists of target gene extraction, rolling circle amplification (RCA), and signal expression. This page describes how we designed the experimental settings to prove the proposed concept and the rationale behind those designs. Due to safety concerns, all of our experiments used Escherichia coli (E. coli) as the chassis instead of the pathogenic resistant bacteria.\nPLASMID CONSTRUCTION\nFor proof of concept purposes, we constructed a pSB1C3-KPC-2-surrogate plasmid that carries a short snippet of the KPC-2 gene by assembling the KPC-2-surrogate gene fragment (BBa_K5041000) with pSB1C3 backbone using the RFC 10 BioBricks assembly standard [1]. Briefly, the partial sequence of the KPC-2-surrogate gene was amplified by PCR (TaKaRa Bio). Both the RFC 10-compatible amplicons and pSB1C3 (from Interlab 2018 Test Device 5 BBa_J364008, Distribution Kit 2024) were then double digested with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes (Anza, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and assembled with T4 ligation (New England Biolabs). Ligation product was used to transform chemically competent DH5α E. coli, and cloned plasmid was later harvested using DNA-spin™ Plasmid DNA Purification Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology) and verified by Sanger sequencing (BGI Genomics).\nROLLING CIRCLE AMPLIFICATION TEMPLATE CONSTRUCTION\nTo facilitate the RCA process, we have constructed a circularised third-generation (v3) RCA template (BBa_K5041004) with the sequence as shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: BBa_K5041004 template sequence\nThe linear oligonucleotide strand was synthesised by IDT and assembled into circular ssDNA form using IDT-synthesised scaffold (5'-GCCACCGCGGTCTCACGGGT-3') and T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), and thus, treated with Exonuclease I and III (Thermo Fisher Scientific and Takara Bio) to remove the remaining scaffold.\nCELL LYSIS\nPrior to the detection system, the collected bacterial sample must be lysed to release its bacterial DNA. In this proof of concept stage, we choose to lyse the cells using SDS. Using SDS to lyse bacterial cells has been an established procedure, which is used in the extraction of plasmids from bacteria using mini-prep kits [2]. SDS lysis could serve as a benchmark for lysis efficiency and plasmid yield when compared to other lysis methods or buffer compositions. The proof of our methodology in lysing the cells using SDS can be viewed here. Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrate the process of cell lysis and its significance in the downstream reactions.\nFigure 2: Cell Lysis and Release of Genomic Material\nFigure 3: Indication of Antibiotic Resistance Gene\nTARGET GENE EXTRACTION\nAfter cell lysis, a snippet of the target gene, which is responsible for antibiotic resistance, is cut using a restriction enzyme and a nickase, as illustrated in Figure 4. The nickase is used to cut the 3' side of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), while the restriction enzyme cuts the 5' side of the gene snippet. The restriction enzyme and nickase used to digest the plasmid in the proof of concept stage are HhaI and Nt.BsmAI (New England Biolabs) respectively.\nFigure 4: Restriction Digestion by Restriction Enzyme (HhaI) and Nickase (Nt.BsmAI)\nFollowing the digestion, Φ29 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs and Beyotime Biotechnology) releases a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) through linear strand displacement amplification (LSDA) as illustrated in Figure 5. Φ-29 binds to the nicked 5' end of the gene, which is the pSB1C3-KPC-2-surrogate in this proof of concept, and then amplifies one strand of the plasmid up to the HhaI cutting site. This process is expected to amplify a 32nt ssDNA from the pSB1C3-KPC-2-surrogate plasmid, which will serve as the primer for the following steps, along with 724 and 534nt ssDNA strands as the side products of this LSDA process.\nFigure 5: Working Mechanism of Φ29 DNA Polymerase\nAn experiment has also been conducted to test this process, and the results can be seen here.\nROLLING CIRCLE AMPLIFICATION\nThe circularised RCA template consists of a primer binding site, where the 32nt ssDNA from the previous step will bind to. As presented in Figure 6, upon this binding, Φ29 DNA polymerase will start to add nucleotides following the primer 3'-end, according to sequences complementary to the RCA template [3]. During this step, we expect cells that do not carry KPC-2 gene will not produce complementary primer, thus, will not trigger the RCA process.\nAfter completing its first round along the RCA template, Φ29 will continue to replicate the RCA template while displacing the complementary strands that it has formed during its previous round [4]. By including the complementary strand of our peroxidase-mimicking G-quadruplex DNAzyme into the RCA template, the RCA process is expected to generate repeats of the G-quadruplex DNAzyme upon the primer binding.\nFigure 6: Step of Rolling Circle Amplification\nThe RCA template also includes the recognition site of the Nt.BsmAI nicking endonuclease. Without Nt.BsmAI, this RCA process will generate a long continuous strand that consists of repeats of the RCA template. However, with the addition of Nt.BsmAI, the Φ29-produced strands will be nicked by the nickase prior to its displacement, producing shorter products out of the amplification process, as shown in Figure 7. This aims to increase the detection sensitivity by mediating exponential RCA [5].\nFigure 7: Rolling Circle Amplification Product\nTo test the RCA reactions and to eliminate interfering factors, we have also conducted the RCA experiments with synthetic RCA primer from IDT. We tested several conditions for the RCA process and the results can be viewed here.\nSIGNAL EXPRESSION\nThe previous step of the system generates G-quadruplex structures that act as peroxidase-mimicking DNAzymes. The products from RCA are then set up into a reaction consisting of haemin, TMB, and H₂O₂. If the RCA process was triggered, G-quadruplex DNAzyme will be formed, and thus produce an observable colour change of the reaction due to the oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to TMB⁺. The positive reaction is hence indicated by a blue colour while the negative reaction does not change colour and remains colourless. Figure 8 illustrates the colour change reaction in the presence of the G-quadruplex DNAzyme.\nFigure 8: Colour Change of Reaction Mixture with G-Quadruplex DNAzyme\nIt is understood that the working mechanism of the DNAzyme involves the attachment of haemin to the G-quadruplex structure, a guanine-rich DNA sequence stabilised by hydrogen bonds, to produce a stable complex [6]. Haemin's iron has the ability to move electrons around to catalyse the conversion of TMB to TMB⁺ [6].\nTo confirm the process of the G-quadruplex DNAzyme reaction, we have also acquired an IDT-synthesised DNA (BBa_K5041001) that will fold into a G-quadruplex structure. All of the experiment results can be found here.\nREMARKS\nWhile our detection system is designed to operate in isothermal conditions, particularly at room temperature, our experiments in the proof of concept stage were largely conducted at the suggested optimum temperatures of the enzyme. We have confirmed that most reactions can occur at 37°C or lower. However, the need for ongoing research is underscored by the requirement for further verification of the enzyme's performance at room temperature. \nREFERENCES\n 1. \"Help:Standards/Assembly/RFC10\", Registry of Standard Biological Parts, https://parts.igem.org/Help:Standards/Assembly/RFC10 (accessed Sep. 24, 2024).\n 2. \"DNA-spinTM Plasmid DNA Purification Kit\", iNtRON Biotechnology, https://intronbio.com:6001/intronbioen/product/product_view.php?PRDT_ID=1 (accessed Sep. 24, 2024).\n 3.

This first-generation circular template contains the G-quadruplex DNAzyme complementary sequences, the annealing sites for the first-generation RCA scaffold and RCA primer, as well as the cutting sites for two DNA-cleaving DNAzymes. The DNA-cleaving DNAzymes, however, were not used in this experiment (see E2.1 for details).\nBUILD\nThe linear single-stranded first-generation RCA template was circularised using a padlock probe ligation method, which involved the first-generation RCA scaffold (BBa_K5041003) and T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs). Subsequently, the first-generation circular template was treated with Exonuclease I (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All DNA used in this experiment was sourced from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).\nTEST\nRCA RESULTS\nFigure 1: RCA using ExoI-Treated Template (v1)\nIn the gel electrophoresis result (Figure 1), lane 1 contained both the first-generation template and the IDT-synthesised RCA primer, while lane 2 contained only the first-generation template. Both lanes exhibited similar smeared bands, with a size greater than 10,000bp, which suggests that successful RCA occurred in both samples. This result indicates a false positive result was generated in our RCA process.\nRCA-GQ COUPLING RESULTS\nFigure 2: RCA(v1)-GQ Coupling\nWhen coupled with the G-quadruplex DNAzyme assay, both samples 1 and 2 exhibited a slight colour change (Figure 2). In this experiment, the product of a failed RCA served as a negative control in the downstream G-quadruplex DNAzyme assay. This failure was likely due to the unsuccessful circularisation of a second-generation RCA template, which inhibited the RCA process (see E1.2). Additionally, we conducted a positive control reaction mixture using IDT-synthesised G-quadruplex DNAzyme (BBa_K5041001), which resulted in a stronger colour change compared to the RCA-generated G-quadruplex DNAzyme.\nLEARN\nThe results of this experiment indicate that an interfering factor was present in the RCA template, triggering the RCA process in both cases, regardless of the presence of the primer. Experiments E1.3 and E1.4 were conducted to troubleshoot and address this issue. Additionally, section 2 discusses the troubleshooting processes for the weak output signal in greater depth.\n[E1.2] SECOND-GENERATION RCA TEMPLATE TREATED WITH EXONUCLEASE I\nSee protocols [P04] and [P05]\nKeyword: FAILED RCA, FAILED TEMPLATE CIRCULARISATION\nDESIGN\nFigure 3: Second-Generation RCA Template (v2)\nDue to the inability of the first-generation (v1) RCA-GQ coupling to produce a strong result (see E2.3), we redesigned our template to promote increased amplification of the G-quadruplex DNAzyme during the RCA process, aiming to as well increase the signal expression level in our G-quadruplex DNAzyme assay. Our new second-generation (v2) RCA template is an 86bp long ssDNA with a phosphate group at the 5'end. The template contains two repeats of the G-quadruplex DNAzyme complementary sequences, the annealing sites for the RCA primer and the second-generation RCA scaffold, as well as three cutting sites for Nt.BsmAI (Figure 3). The cutting by Nt.BsmAI is designed to separate individual G-quadruplex DNAzyme structures and to exponentially amplify the RCA primer throughout the RCA process.\nBUILD\nThe linear single-stranded second-generation RCA template was circularised through a padlock probe ligation method involving the second-generation RCA scaffold which shares the same sequences as the third-generation (v3) RCA scaffold (BBa_K5041005) and T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs). The circular template was then treated with Exonuclease I (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All DNAs used in this experiment were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies.\nTEST\nRCA RESULTS\nFigure 4: RCA using ExoI-Treated Template (v2)\nIn the gel electrophoresis result (Figure 4), lane 1 contained both the second-generation template and the IDT-synthesised RCA primer, while lane 2 contained only the second-generation template. Both lanes did not show any visible bands above the 10,000bp DNA marker, suggesting that the RCA process had failed in both samples.\nLEARN\nWhile the absence of the RCA primer did not affect the success or failure of the RCA reaction on both lanes, the presence of the RCA primer did affect the amplification rate of the RCA process, according to the gel result. The shorter bands visible on lane 1 were possibly due to the ligation of two or more linear single-stranded second-generation RCA templates due to the RCA scaffold acting as a splint DNA flanking across two linear RCA templates. It is only visible on lane 1 due to a higher amplification rate in the presence of the RCA primer.\nMoreover, no product larger than 10,000bp was generated from both RCA reaction mixtures, suggesting a failure in circularising the second-generation RCA template. This issue was troubleshot in our following experiments (see E1.3 and E1.4).\n[E1.3] THIRD-GENERATION RCA TEMPLATE TREATED WITH TRITON X-100 AND EXONUCLEASE I\nSee protocols [P06] and [P07]\nKeyword: FALSE POSITIVE\nDESIGN\nFirstly, due to the false positive result in E1.1 and the assumption that the RCA scaffold in E1.1 was not completely removed from the first-generation (v1) RCA template, we tested a method of Exonuclease I treatment, supplemented by the addition of Triton to detach the RCA scaffold from the RCA template following the circularisation process. Secondly, as a result of the weak signal expressed by the G-quadruplex DNAzyme from the first-generation RCA template and the failed RCA process from the second-generation (v2) RCA template, we designed a third-generation (v3) RCA template (BBa_K5041004) and scaffold (BBa_K5041005). The third-generation RCA template shares features similar to the second-generation, with one repeat of each G-quadruplex DNAzyme complementary sequence and the Nt.BsmAI cutting site removed, resulting in a shorter 62bp ssDNA compared to the second generation. Similarly, the cutting by Nt.BsmAI is designed to separate individual G-quadruplex DNAzyme structures and exponentially amplify the RCA primer throughout the RCA process.\nBUILD\nThe linear single-stranded third-generation RCA template was circularised through a padlock probe ligation method involving the third-generation RCA scaffold and T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs). The circular template was then treated with Exonuclease I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Triton X-100 (Bio-Rad Laboratories). All DNAs used in this experiment were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies.\nTEST\nRCA RESULTS\nFigure 5: RCA using ExoI and Triton-Treated Template (v3)\nIn the gel electrophoresis result (Figure 5), lane 1 contained both the third-generation template (treated with Triton and Exonuclease I) and the IDT-synthesised RCA primer, while lane 2 contained only the third-generation template (treated with Triton and Exonuclease I). Lane 3 contained the third-generation template (treated Exonuclease I only) and the IDT-synthesised RCA primer, while lane 4 contained only the third-generation template (treated Exonuclease I only).\nAll lanes exhibited similar smeared bands, with a size greater than 10,000bp, which suggests that successful RCA occurred in all samples.\nLEARN\nThis troubleshooting process did not solve our concurring issue of false positive results. The combined Triton and Exonuclease I treatment was not sufficient to remove the attaching scaffold, which presumably contributed to the constantly occurring false positives. Follow-up troubleshooting is described in E1.4.\n[E1.4] THIRD-GENERATION RCA TEMPLATE TREATED WITH EXONUCLEASE I AND III\nSee protocols [P08], [P09], and [P10]\nKeyword: SUCCESSFULLY ELIMINATED FALSE POSITIVE\nDESIGN\nThe third-generation (v3) RCA template (BBa_K5041004) features one repeat of the G-quadruplex DNAzyme complementary sequence, the Nt.BsmAI cutting site and primer binding site, resulting in a total length of 62nt ssDNA. As described in E1.3, our third-generation RCA template rendered false positives even after being treated with Triton X-100. To address this problem, we went for another troubleshooting process and decided to modify our circularisation method.\nBUILD\nThe linear single-stranded third-generation RCA template was circularised through a padlock probe ligation method involving the third-generation RCA scaffold (BBa_K5041005) and T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs). The circular template was then treated with Exonuclease I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Exonuclease III (TaKaRa Bio). All DNAs used in this experiment were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies.\nTEST\nRCA RESULTS\nFigure 6: RCA using ExoI- and ExoIII-Treated Template (v3)\nIn the gel electrophoresis result (Figure 6), lane 1 contained both the third-generation template (treated with Exonuclease I and III) and the IDT-synthesised RCA primer in a mixture with Nt.BsmAI nicking endonuclease (New England Biolabs). Lane 2 contained both the third-generation template (treated with Exonuclease I and III) and the IDT-synthesised RCA primer without Nt.BsmAI. Lane 3 contained only the third-generation template (treated with Exonuclease I and III) without primer nor Nt.BsmAI.\nLane 1 exhibited a smearing band across the entire lane, indicating successful RCA and a successful cut by Nt.BsmAI. Lane 2 exhibited a smearing band, concentrated at a size larger than 10,000bp, which suggests that successful RCA occurred in the sample. Lane 3 did not have any visible band, indicating that we successfully obtained both true negative and positive results from this circularisation method.\nRCA-GQ COUPLING RESULTS\nFigure 7: RCA-GQ Coupling using ExoI- and ExoIII-Treated Template (v3)\nWhen coupled with the G-quadruplex DNAzyme assay, both samples 1 and 2 exhibited a slight colour change (Figure 7), while sample 3, the negative RCA result, did not show any colour change. The last shown sample was a positive control reaction mixture using IDT-synthesised G-quadruplex DNAzyme (BBa_K5041001), which resulted in a stronger colour change compared to the RCA-generated G-quadruplex DNAzyme.\nLEARN\nThis troubleshooting process confirmed that Exonuclease I treatment was not sufficient to remove the attaching scaffold, which presumably contributed to the constantly occurring false positives. The addition of Exonuclease III into the circularisation reaction mixture eliminated the problem. However, the signal remains weak from the RCA-GQ coupling, which will be further addressed in E2.6.\n[E2] RCA-GQ COUPLING SIGNAL OPTIMISATION\n[E2.1] DNA-CLEAVING DNAZYMES TEST\nSee protocol [P11]\nKeyword: FAILED DNA-CLEAVING\nDESIGN\nOur first-generation (v1) circular template (BBa_K5041002) is a 49bp long ssDNA with a phosphate group at the 5' end. This first-generation circular template contains the G-quadruplex DNAzyme complementary sequences, the annealing sites for the first-generation RCA scaffold and RCA primer, as well as the cutting sites for two DNA-cleaving DNAzymes. The DNA-cleaving DNAzymes were designed to cleave the RCA products and promote exponential RCA by releasing the amplified primer.\nThe two DNA-cleaving DNAzymes used in this experiment are (5'-AGCGGCCATTATACCGGGCAACTATTGCCTCGTCATCGCTATTTTCTGCGACCCACCCA-3') and (5'-CCACCCACCTATACCGGGCAACTATTGCCTCGTCATCGCTATTTTCTGCGTGGCAGAAA-3'). We also designed a 147nt ssDNA fragment consisting of three repeats of the G-quadruplex DNAzyme sequences and DNA-cleaving DNAzymes cutting sites to simulate the RCA product. All DNA used in this experiment was sourced from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).\nTEST\nDNA-CLEAVING DNAZYMES TEST\nFigure 8: DNA-Cleaving DNAzymes Test\nIn the gel electrophoresis result (Figure 8), lane 1 contained the DNA-cleaving DNAzymes with the 147nt ssDNA fragment. Lane 2 contained the 147nt ssDNA fragment only, while lane 3 contained one of the 59nt DNA-cleaving DNAzymes. Lane 2 was not loaded with the same amount of 147nt ssDNA fragment as in lane (!).\nThe result showed no catalytic activity from the DNA-cleaving DNAzymes since the 147nt fragment remains visible in lane 1, and the only other visible band in lane 1 was similar to that of lane 3. This indicated that lane 1 only contained the uncut 147nt fragment with 59nt DNA-cleaving DNAzymes.\nLEARN\nThe results of this experiment indicate that we were unable to use the DNA-cleaving DNAzymes to cut our first-generation RCA products. This contributed to the decision not to use the DNA-cleaving DNAzymes during RCA in E1.1. This also influenced our decision to move our direction to the use of nicking endonuclease in our second- and third-generation RCA templates (see E1.2). Additionally, the change of direction was also taken by considering the facilitation of RCA and G-quadruplex DNAzyme assay coupling. In other words, coupling RCA and G-quadruplex DNAzyme assays with this method may not be ideal since the DNA-cleaving DNAzymes require different buffer conditions.\n[E2.2] FIRST-GENERATION RCA IN RCUTSMART BUFFER\nSee protocols [P12], [P13], and [P14]\nKeyword: Φ29 IN rCUTSMART, FAILED SIGNAL EXPRESSION\nDESIGN\nIn our project mechanism, both the RCA and primer extraction processes are to be completed in one reaction mixture. To facilitate this coupling, the RCA process needs to be compatible with the rCutSmart Buffer so that all three enzymes, HhaI (New England Biolabs), Nt.BsmAI (New England Biolabs), and Φ29 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs and Beyotime Biotechnology) can work together at the same time. Usually, Φ29 DNA polymerase is supplied with a 10X reaction buffer; however, Φ29 DNA polymerase is compatible with rCutSmart buffer when additional dithiothreitol (DTT) is added to the reaction [1].\nOur first-generation (v1) circular template (BBa_K5041002) is a 49bp long ssDNA with a phosphate group at the 5' end. This first-generation circular template contains the G-quadruplex DNAzyme complementary sequences, the annealing sites for the first-generation RCA scaffold and RCA primer, as well as the cutting sites for two DNA-cleaving DNAzymes. The DNA-cleaving DNAzymes, however, were not used in this experiment (see E2.1 for details).\nBUILD\nThe linear single-stranded first-generation RCA template was circularised using a padlock probe ligation method, which involved the first-generation RCA scaffold (BBa_K5041003) and T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs). Subsequently, the first-generation circular template was treated with Exonuclease I (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All DNA used in this experiment was sourced from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).\nTEST\nRCA RESULTS\nFigure 9: RCA (v1) Using rCutSmart Buffer with Additional DTT\nIn the gel electrophoresis result (Figure 9), the (+) lane consisted of both the first-generation template and the IDT-synthesised RCA primer. The lane exhibited similar smeared bands, with a size greater than 10,000bp, which suggests that successful RCA occurred in the sample. This proved that Φ29 is compatible with the rCutSmart Buffer in the presence of additional DTT.\nRCA-GQ COUPLING RESULTS\nFigure 10: RCA(v1)-GQ Coupling\nWhen coupled with the G-quadruplex DNAzyme assay, the RCA product did not induce a colour change, as shown in Figure 10. A control set-up with IDT-synthesised G-quadruplex sequences (BBa_K5041001) exhibited a strong colour change but remained transparent in addition to DTT.\nLEARN\nWe thus found out that DTT is a reducing agent, while the colour change in the G-quadruplex assay is dependent on the oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to TMB⁺. The presence of DTT in the reaction mixture most likely inhibited the oxidation of TMB, preventing any observation of colour change. E2.3 was conducted to troubleshoot this issue.\n[E2.3] FIRST-GENERATION RCA IN RCUTSMART BUFFER WITHOUT DTT\nSee protocols [P15], [P16], and [P17]\nKeyword: Φ29 IN rCUTSMART WITHOUT DTT, WEAK SIGNAL EXPRESSION\nDESIGN\nWith our discovery in E2.1, we decided to rerun the reaction without additional (dithiothreitol) DTT added into the RCA reaction mixture with first-generation (v1) RCA template (BBa_K5041002) and scaffold (BBa_K5041003).\nBUILD\nThe linear single-stranded first-generation RCA template was circularised using a padlock probe ligation method, which involved the first-generation RCA scaffold and T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs). Subsequently, the first-generation circular template was treated with Exonuclease I (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All DNA used in this experiment was sourced from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).\nTEST\nRCA RESULTS\nFigure 11: RCA (v1) in rCutSmart Buffer without DTT\nIn the gel electrophoresis result (Figure 11), lane 1 consisted of both the first-generation template and the IDT-synthesised RCA primer, while lane 2 consisted only of the template. The lanes exhibited similar smeared bands, with a size greater than 10,000bp, which suggests that successful RCA occurred in both of the samples. Though having a false positive result (see E1.1 for details), the RCA reaction was successful despite the absence of additional DTT.\nRCA-GQ COUPLING RESULTS\nFigure 12: RCA(v1)-GQ Coupling\nWhen coupled with the G-quadruplex DNAzyme assay (Figure 12), the first sample of the RCA product induced a slight colour change, as shown in Figure 10, while the false positive RCA sample showed no colour change.\nLEARN\nThis result provided us with two sets of information. Firstly, of that compatibility of Φ29 in rCutSmart buffer without additional DTT. Secondly, this troubleshooting process does not completely solve the problem since the expressed signal was not strong enough. One possible reason is because of the presence of DTT in the enzymes' storing buffer, which is also transferred to the RCA reaction mixture. A follow-up troubleshooting was conducted to address this problem, as described in E1.2.\n[E2.4] G-QUADRUPLEX CONCENTRATION AND SIGNAL EXPRESSION CORRELATION\nSee protocol [P18]\nKeyword: SIGNAL EXPRESSION CORRELATION\nDESIGN\nWith the constantly occurring weak signals, we tried to brainstorm potential factors contributing to the signal expression level. One experiment we did to troubleshoot this problem was assessing the correlation of the G-quadruplex concentration in the reaction mixture and the signal expressed. Thus, we used the IDT-synthesised G-quadruplex sequences (BBa_K5041001) in different concentrations to assess whether it contributed to the strength of the signal.\nTEST\nG-QUADRUPLEX DNAZYME ASSAY RESULTS\nFigure 13: G-Quadruplex Concentration Assay Test\nWe prepared 4 reaction mixtures, with 1.2µM, 0.8µM, 0.4µM, and 0.04µM of IDT-synthesised G-quadruplex structure, respectively. As shown in Figure 13, a significant difference was exhibited by the sample that contained the least amount of the G-quadruplex structure.\nLEARN\nThough the G-quadruplex Structure is a peroxidase-mimicking DNAzyme, which mimics the ability of an enzyme, the concentration of the structure in the solution influences the final colour of the reaction. This means we must increase the quantity of the G-quadruplex DNAzyme to obtain a stronger signal.\n[E2.5] THIRD-GENERATION RCA WITHOUT EXONUCLEASE I TREATMENT\nSee protocols [P19], [P20], and [P21]\nKeyword: THIRD-GENERATION RCA, STRONG SIGNAL EXPRESSION\nDESIGN\nThe third-generation (v3) RCA template (BBa_K5041004) features one repeat of the G-quadruplex DNAzyme complementary sequence, the Nt.BsmAI cutting site and primer binding site, resulting in a total length of 62nt ssDNA. As described in E1.3, our third-generation RCA template rendered false positives even after being treated with Triton X-100 and Exonuclease I. Thus, to solve the weak signal generation simultaneously with eliminating false positives, we designed this experiment using a third-generation RCA template without any treatment. This means that the RCA scaffold remains attached to the circularised template.\nBUILD\nThe linear single-stranded third-generation RCA template was circularised through a padlock probe ligation method involving the third-generation RCA scaffold (BBa_K5041005) and T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs). All DNAs used in this experiment were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies.\nTEST\nRCA RESULTS\nFigure 14: RCA (v3) Without ExoI Treatment\nIn the gel electrophoresis result (Figure 14), lane 1 contained both the third-generation template and the IDT-synthesised RCA primer in a mixture with Nt.BsmAI nicking endonuclease (New England Biolabs). Lane 2 contained both the third-generation template and the IDT-synthesised RCA primer without Nt.BsmAI.\nLane 1 exhibited a smearing band across the entire lane, indicating successful RCA and successfully cut by Nt.BsmAI. Lane 2 exhibited a smearing band, concentrated at a size larger than 10,000bp, which suggests that successful RCA occurred in the sample.\nRCA-GQ COUPLING RESULTS\nFigure 15: RCA-GQ Coupling Without ExoI Treatment\nWhen coupled with the G-quadruplex DNAzyme assay, both samples 1 and 2 exhibited a visible colour change (Figure 15), stronger than the result observed in previous experiments E2.3 and E1.1. The positive control reaction mixture using IDT-synthesised G-quadruplex DNAzyme (BBa_K5041001), however, resulted in a stronger colour change compared to the RCA-generated G-quadruplex DNAzyme.\nLEARN\nThis troubleshooting process indicated that stronger signals can be obtained from the RCA-generated G-quadruplex DNAzyme.\n[E2.6] THIRD-GENERATION WITH DIFFERENT TEMPLATE CONCENTRATIONS\nSee protocols [P22], [P23], and [P24]\nKeyword: THIRD-GENERATION RCA, SUCCESSFUL\nDESIGN\nBuilding upon the successful E1.4, we tried to further optimise the expressed signals. From E2.4, we understand that G-quadruplex concentration contributes to the final signals, and it is possible to obtain stronger signals from RCA-generated G-quadruplex DNAzyme (see E2.5). Hence, we tested different quantities of the third-generation (v3) RCA template (BBa_K5041004) in the RCA reaction to observe its correlation with the signal expression level.\nBUILD\nThe linear single-stranded third-generation RCA template was circularised through a padlock probe ligation method involving the third-generation RCA scaffold (BBa_K5041005) and T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs). The circular template was then treated with Exonuclease I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Exonuclease III (TaKaRa Bio). All DNAs used in this experiment were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies.\nTEST\nRCA RESULTS\nFigure 16: RCA (v3) using ExoI- and ExoIII-Treated Template with Different Concentrations\nIn the gel electrophoresis result (Figure 16), lanes 1-4 contained the third-generation template (treated with Exonuclease I and III) and the IDT-synthesised RCA primer in a mixture with Nt.BsmAI nicking endonuclease (New England Biolabs). The template quantities are 1ng, 2ng, 4ng, and 8ng respectively. Lane 5 contained both the third-generation template (treated with Exonuclease I and III) and the IDT-synthesised RCA primer without Nt.BsmAI. Lane 6 contained only the third-generation template (treated with Exonuclease I and III) without primer nor Nt.BsmAI.\nLanes 1-4 exhibited a smearing band across the entire lane, indicating successful RCA and a successful cut by Nt.BsmAI. The intensity of the band also increases with more templates in the reaction. Lane 5 exhibited a smearing band, concentrated at a size larger than 10,000bp, which suggests that successful RCA occurred in the sample. Lane 6 had no visible band, indicating that we successfully obtained true negative results from this circularisation method.\nRCA-GQ COUPLING RESULTS\nFigure 17: RCA(v3)-GQ Coupling using ExoI- and ExoIII-Treated Template with Different Concentrations\nWhen coupled with the G-quadruplex DNAzyme assay, both samples 1 and 2 exhibited a similar slight colour change (Figure 17), while samples 3 and 4 had a stronger colour change. Sample 5 had a similar colour change as 1, while sample 6 did not show any colour change. The last shown sample was a positive control reaction mixture using IDT-synthesised G-quadruplex DNAzyme (BBa_K5041001), which still resulted in a stronger colour change than the RCA-generated G-quadruplex DNAzyme.\nLEARN\nThis experiment confirmed that a stronger signal can be obtained by increasing the template quantity in the reaction. With these results, a new standard of 4ng template in a 20 µl reaction will be used in our future experiments. However, this result did not prove that third-generation RCA products are generated by both the RCA process and the RCA process.BsmAI cutting is more effective than uncut RCA products. This result also did not prove that the third-generation RCA template yielded a better result than the first-generation RCA template. These two limitations are to be addressed in the future, in addition to the primer extraction-RCA coupling method validation.\nREFERENCES\n 1. \"Activity of DNA modifying enzymes in rCutSmart™ buffer\", New England Biolabs, https://www.neb.com/en/tools-and-resources/usage-guidelines/activity-of-dna-modifying-enzymes-in-cutsmart-buffer (accessed Sep. 25, 2024)."

        "content": "This page presents critical experimental data from our wet lab activities throughout the project. For more details on the experiment design rationale, please see Proof of Concept. For further experimental data, including the troubleshooting processes, please see Engineering Success. Protocols that we used to conduct our experiments in this page are available in our Notebook.\nCELL LYSIS: SDS TREATMENT\nSee protocol [P25]\nFigure 1: Microscopy images of E. coli cells before and after treating with SDS\nAs described in our Proof of Concept, we selected SDS to lyse our cells. Figure 1 shows the results of our SDS treatment of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the form of microscopy pictures. We selected an area in both photographs and magnified the selected area for comparison. We can observe more intact cells in the left image, marked in red circles, compared to the picture on the right. This indicates that the lysis of E. coli using SDS at room temperature was successful. More robust luciferase-based tests are planned to verify this method further quantitatively.\nTARGET GENE EXTRACTION: NT.BSMAI/HHAI-LSDA\nSee protocol [P26]\nFigure 2: Gel electrophoresis of Nt.BsmAI/HhaI-LSDA\nIn this project, we extract our primer, which will be used in downstream reactions through LSDA. This process involves the nicking and cutting of pSB1C3-KPC-2-surrogate by Nt.BsmAI and HhaI. As illustrated in our Proof of Concept, this process is expected to amplify a 32nt ssDNA from the pSB1C3-KPC-2-surrogate plasmid, along with 724 and 534nt ssDNA strands as the side products of this LSDA process. Figure 2 shows that our LSDA reaction has successfully generated the 724 and 534nt ssDNA. However, we cannot detect the 32nt primer, potentially due to its smaller size. To validate this method further, we will combine this reaction with RCA to determine if it can produce a positive RCA result.\nNote that in this preliminary experiment, we performed 45 minutes of digestion, followed by incubating with Φ29 for an extra 15 minutes to prevent the displaced ssDNA from Φ29 exonuclease activity. However, this two-step reaction is unnecessary in the target gene extraction-RCA coupling since the extracted primer will immediately bind to the RCA template.\nROLLING CIRCLE AMPLIFICATION\nRCA IN RCUTSMART\nSee protocols [P27] and [P28]\nFigure 3: Gel electrophoresis of RCA in rCutSmart\nThe reaction mixture must be compatible with both reactions to facilitate the coupling of the target gene extraction and the RCA process. Therefore, we tested whether Φ29 is compatible with the rCutSmart buffer, which is the primary buffer for Nt.BsmAI and HhaI. Figure 3 demonstrates that the RCA process can be entirely performed in the rCutSmart buffer. This is indicated by the presence of smearing bands, with a size larger than the 10,000bp DNA ladder, in both the \"10× Reaction Buffer\" and \"rCutSmart Buffer\" lanes. The smearing bands are expected due to the continuous amplification by RCA and the generation of variable-length amplification products. The result of experiment E2.3 also obtains further verification.\nTHIRD-GENERATION RCA\nSee protocols [P22] and [P23]\nFigure 4: Gel electrophoresis of third-generation RCA\nWe have also verified both our RCA template circularisation and our RCA methods. With our third-generation RCA template (BBa_K5041004), we can obtain satisfactory results for our RCA. \nIn Figure 4, lanes 1-4 included both the third-generation (v3) template (treated with Exonuclease I and III) and the RCA primer (Integrated DNA Technologies), mixed with the Nt.BsmAI nicking endonuclease (New England Biolabs). The template amounts were 1ng, 2ng, 4ng, and 8ng, respectively. Lane 5 contained the same template and RCA primer without Nt.BsmAI, while lane 6 had only the third-generation template (treated with Exonuclease I and III), with neither the primer nor Nt.BsmAI.\nLanes 1-4 displayed a smearing band throughout, indicating successful RCA and effective cutting by Nt.BsmAI, with band intensity increasing alongside the template amounts. Lane 5 showed a smearing band concentrated at sizes larger than 10,000bp, suggesting successful RCA in that sample. In contrast, lane 6 had no detected band, confirming that we obtained true negative results from this circularisation method.\nSIGNAL EXPRESSION: G-QUADRUPLEX DNAZYME ASSAY\nSee protocol [P24]\nFigure 5: G-quadruplex DNAzyme coupling assay results\nTo verify our project mechanism, we coupled the RCA results obtained in Figure 4 for the G-quadruplex assay. As shown in Figure 5, both samples 1 and 2 exhibited a similar slight colour change to blue, while samples 3 and 4 had a more robust colour change. Sample 5 exhibited a similar colour change as 1, while sample 6 did not produce an observable blue colour. The last shown sample was a positive control reaction mixture using IDT-synthesised G-quadruplex DNAzyme (BBa_K5041001). These results indicate that we have successfully coupled our third-generation RCA reaction with the G-quadruplex assay. \nCONCLUSION\nWe have individually tested the cell lysis and target gene extraction and coupled the RCA reaction with the G-quadruplex DNAzyme assay. The experimental results support the claim that the project is feasible and the mechanism is valid. To further support our claim, more experiments are planned to confirm the coupling of all reactions.\nADDITIONAL KEY INFORMATION\nAll processes in our detection system are designed to be completed at room temperature. While we have confirmed that most reactions can occur at 37°C or below, we primarily performed the experiments at the recommended optimal temperature for each enzyme to ease detection and validate the concept. Further optimisation on the individual steps is needed to evaluate the product performance at room temperature. In the future, we are also planning to characterise our detection system on its sensitivity and specificity. "

        "content": "Synthetic biology education has seen remarkable growth in recent years. Especially with the recent development of STEM education in Hong Kong, more students are now being introduced to biotechnology and synthetic biology. At ResiSense, we prioritise quality over quantity. Rather than offering generic workshops, we collaborate with different communities to identify gaps and shortcomings in the system, carefully craft each outreach event to address the specific needs of the target community and make a meaningful impact. \nREGIONAL SYMPOSIUM\nBuilding a community beyond the bench\nSummertime is a peak for collaboration in iGEM, yet no official events were available for teams to mingle and exchange ideas. To fill this void, we took the initiative to form an organising committee with four other teams, co-hosting a regional symposium tailored to our specific needs.\nTraditional symposiums are often less effective because each team has different areas of expertise, making it challenging to provide meaningful feedback or gain valuable insights. That was why our symposium was themed \"Beyond the Bench: Bridging the Gap Between Research and Community\". Rather than focusing solely on technical research presentations, our symposium raised two critical questions to each team: how they can ensure their project to be instrumental in its intended field and how they can educate the public on the issue their project addresses. We believe this approach fostered deeper discussions on the real-world impact and outreach of our synthetic biology projects.\nHeld at the HKU campus on 5 August 2024, our symposium accommodated ten teams and over 100 participants, creating the perfect chance for collaboration and knowledge exchange. The event was structured into three parts: team presentations, poster presentation cum networking, and expert sharing.\nTEAM PRESENTATIONS\nFor the team presentations, we invited experienced science communicator Dr Helen Ma and our very own PI Professor Jacky Ngo as guests to provide feedback to the participating team. A short Q&A session and targeted feedback by our guests followed each team's presentation. While Professor Ngo's insights focused on how effectively each team could address their target problem in addition to various technical critiques, Dr Ma advised us on how best to present our findings in a compelling and accessible manner, highlighting multiple effective communication strategies. \nPOSTER PRESENTATION CUM NETWORKING\nWe set up a venue at InnoWing, a free collaborative space at HKU, to allow teams to display their posters as an interlude after the presentations, and it proved to be the perfect opportunity for insightful exchanges and mingling. Teams were encouraged to visit others' panels, discuss project ideas, and offer suggestions, inspiring one another to think outside the box. This networking segment was designed to foster potential collaborations, allowing teams to form connections that could lead to future partnerships in iGEM or beyond.\nEXPERT SHARING\nLast but not least, the expert sharing segment featured Dr Helen Ma, who shared her extensive experience as a science communicator. She provided practical tips on engaging the general public with specific scientific concepts and lectured us on important considerations when presenting scientific data. The second speaker was a former iGEM team member from HKUST, who discussed the challenges they faced during their iGEM journey and how they overcame them. He offered valuable advice on progressing their projects beyond the confines of iGEM, encouraging us to think critically about the broader impact of our work.\nCUHK ARTS FAIR\nBringing science closer to the public\nIn our efforts to address the misconceptions surrounding antibiotic resistance, as highlighted to be a problem in our prior discussions with Dr Helen Ma and Dr Victor Lau, we decided to start at the university level. University students are future leaders and professionals who play crucial roles in spreading accurate knowledge about the severity of antibiotic resistance. By equipping them with scientific concepts, we hope they can act as a beacon for spreading information in their household and community, raising awareness of this critical issue while combating misinformation.\nFUN AND GAMES\nTo further our goals, we opened a booth at the CUHK Arts Fair, a vibrant three-day promotion event where we presented information and engaged participants in conversations and interactive activities. Through informative posters and a simple card game, we educated them about the severity of antibiotic resistance and cleared up some common misconceptions surrounding antibiotic use. We also shared our project findings and methodologies with interested students, while some postgraduate students and staff engaged with us to exchange research ideas and approaches related to antibiotic resistance.\nSOUVENIR MINI-WORKSHOP\nAdditionally, we wanted to introduce synthetic biology as a subject and explain the methodologies and processes involved in an iGEM project. Participants had the opportunity to get (tangential-related) hands-on experience in synthetic biology by creating Petri dish keychains. The miniature Petri dishes contained a mock culture medium made with resin, and we allowed them to design their custom bacterial patterns and draw them using white markers. This small souvenir workshop proved to be an effective way of attracting people to visit our booth, and we used the opportunity to introduce them to the streaking technique and various culture media commonly used in microbiology. We believe this interactive experience fostered a deeper understanding of synthetic biology and empowered them to become ambassadors for antibiotic awareness and education in their communities with a small trinket as a reminder.\nCOMMUNITY CENTRE CHILDREN'S WORKSHOP\nInspire curiosity for synthetic biology\nWith the growing emphasis on STEM education, biotechnology has become a significant focus in higher education. To explore educational initiatives for younger students, we interviewed Mr Cian Wu from the Hong Kong Amgen Biotechnology Experience about their outreach programme. They offer hands-on activities, such as pipetting and gel electrophoresis, to both primary and secondary school students, as well as at community centres. For younger students, the emphasis is on engaging them in hands-on experiments rather than delving deeply into concepts. In our discussion, we proposed a more conceptual workshop centred on the underlying principles of biotechnology, with Mr Cian recommending that we start with the fundamental concept of DNA. Our workshop aimed to introduce DNA and biotechnology entertainingly and interactively. Through this initiative, we aimed to lay a solid foundation and create a positive first impression of biotechnology in the minds of young learners, paving the way for their future education in this field.\nOn 14 September 2024, we conducted a children's workshop at the Tsung Tsin Mission Full Grace Service Centre, a community centre located in Sham Shui Po. Using logo-like models and cartoon references, we introduced the concept of DNA and its basic structure engagingly. With the assistance of our team, participants performed the classic strawberry DNA extraction experiment, which helped illustrate how DNA exists in all organisms and convey its relevance in their everyday lives.\nWe also explored what a day in the life of a biotechnologist or microbiologist looks like, explaining how bacteria play a crucial role in synthetic biology and introducing the concept of streaking. In the arts & crafts session, participants had the opportunity to mimic the streaking technique by creating Petri dish keychains, similar to during the Arts Fair. This hands-on approach reinforced their understanding of microbiology and fostered excitement about the biotechnology field.\nSECONDARY SCHOOL GEL ELECTROPHORESIS WORKSHOP\nTailoring to the local education system\nSchool schedules are often tightly packed throughout the year in Hong Kong, where students spend much of their secondary school years preparing for the public university entrance exam, HKDSE. Many students elect to spend their weekends and after-school hours attending tutorial classes to improve their exam results. \nBiotechnology was incorporated into the biology curriculum as an elective topic. As a subject that highly involves experiments, the HKDSE biology exam frequently includes experiment-based questions. However, not all schools have adequate equipment or class time to provide students with hands-on laboratory experience. Based on our past experience, students often struggle with understanding experimental principles without practical exposure and, hence, tend to perform poorly on troubleshooting questions.\nWORKSHOP DESIGN\nThis workshop was held at the CUHK Life Sciences Lab on 21 September 2024. We designed it specifically for HKDSE students and tailored the teaching approach to align more closely with the exam format, making it highly relevant to their needs. Our goal was to deepen students' understanding of gel electrophoresis and equip them with the critical thinking skills required to tackle troubleshooting questions. By allowing them to experiment hands-on, we aim to solidify their conceptual grasp and boost their confidence in experimental questions.\nGEL ELECTROPHORESIS LECTURE AND EXPERIMENT\nThe first part of the workshop focused on the basic understanding of gel electrophoresis, with references to past HKDSE exam papers to provide students with a sense of familiarity. We used example questions, such as the use of gel electrophoresis in forensic science, to connect theory with real-world applications. In the hands-on portion of the workshop, students started from the basics, learning essential lab skills like pipetting under the guidance of our team members and eventually loaded their gels for the experiment.\nTROUBLESHOOTING WORKSHOP\nThe second part of the workshop focused on developing troubleshooting skills. A brief lecture was given to teach them the fundamental steps involved in troubleshooting an experiment. Students were then given multiple images of problematic gels, and in small groups, they discussed potential issues and suggested solutions. With guidance from our team members, they learned to approach troubleshooting methodically, simultaneously enhancing their practical lab skills and exam problem-solving abilities.\nAFTERWORD\nWe are proud to say that we successfully filled the class, teaching over 20 students from multiple schools, with no small part attributing to us tailoring the content to align with the HKDSE curriculum closely. We were thrilled to have had the opportunity to connect with local secondary school students. We send them our best wishes for their public exams and hope we managed to spark an interest in synthetic biology that shall sprout in their coming years of study.\nHKUST YSIP GUEST SPEAKER\nGuidance for future scientists  \nOn 27 August 2024, we were invited to HKUST to participate in the Youth Scientist Incubation Programme (YSIP)'s final presentation and biotech career-building day. YSIP is a summer initiative by the HKUST iGEM team that aimed to deepen secondary school students' understanding of synthetic biology and provide them with first-hand experience working on a mini iGEM project. During the final presentation, the students showcased the projects they had developed over the summer, simulating the iGEM experience.\nAs iGEM participants and STEM undergraduates, we provided feedback on the feasibility and creativity of their projects, offering insights on how they could refine their ideas further. We also shared our experiences pursuing STEM majors, discussing the pathways to a career in life sciences and how to translate the skills gained from iGEM into undergraduate studies and the workplace.\nNearing the end of the event, we mingled with the secondary schoolers, answering their questions about academic pursuits and career planning and offering advice on navigating the world of synthetic biology. By speaking at this event as a guest, we hoped to guide these aspiring young scientists as they take their first steps into the world of STEM and synthetic biology.\nCITYU SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY TALK GUEST SPEAKER\nEducation beyond Hong Kong\nOn 27 July 2024, we collaborated with the CityU iGEM team as guest lecturers for their online synthetic biology talk \"Biohacking for a Better World\", aimed at global secondary school students. This workshop allowed students to understand better how synthetic biology can be leveraged to address real-world challenges while connecting with the passionate researchers behind this innovative field. Recognising that many secondary school students are often new to synthetic biology and may feel overwhelmed by the extensive research concepts presented, we aimed to provide a more accessible introduction as the first guest lecturers. Our goal was to guide them in navigating the day's lectures and understanding synthetic biology in a more relatable way.\nDelivered by our very own biochemistry student Jeffrey Chau and biomedical engineering student Fiona Lam, our presentation shared our journey in iGEM and offered insights on how to enter the field of synthetic biology. We also provided an overview of synthetic biology, citing recent developments and other teams' and our contributions to the field. By emphasising practical applications and real-world relevance, we hoped to inspire students and encourage them to explore synthetic biology further, empowering them to become future innovators.\nINSTAGRAM POSTS\nGarnering public engagement  \nWe used Instagram as a platform for the public to engage with and learn more about our iGEM project. Beyond just updates, it also served as an interactive educational tool where we featured a series of posts dedicated to teaching synthetic biology to our target audience. Our first three posts covered the basics of synthetic biology (1, 2, 3), specifically designed for beginners who are new to the field. Once our followers have grasped these fundamentals, we introduced examples and shared news (1, 2) related to the latest developments in synthetic biology in subsequent posts, keeping our audience engaged and involved.\nOur Instagram stories aimed to be approachable and relatable, offering a glimpse into our day-to-day work and team dynamics. This helped create a friendly and down-to-earth atmosphere where anyone can ask questions directly. Through this engagement, we hoped to foster a supportive community eager to learn about synthetic biology."

        "content": "This page details our dry lab work on the G-quad-haemin complex. To download our various resources, see the resources page.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn our project, G-quadruplex DNAzyme (G-quad) is the last step in our detection mechanism, which produces a visible colour change when the target gene is detected. The colour change is due to the peroxidase-mimicking activity when the G-quadruplex DNAzyme is bound with haemin (G-quad-haemin), which catalyses the oxidation of TMB (colourless) to TMB⁺ (blue) in the presence of H₂O₂, as shown in Equation 1 [1]. The literature has shown that the binding of haemin to G-quad is crucial to the catalytic activity of G-quad [2], and G-quadruplex is more stable in a mixture of water and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) [3].\nSince two of the reagents in the reaction, haemin and TMB, also have better solubility in DMSO than in water [4], [5], it is postulated that adding more DMSO to the reaction mixture may help G-quad work faster. To investigate this, a molecular dynamics (MD) approach has been developed to calculate the binding energy of haemin to G-quad at different concentrations of DMSO in water.\nEquation 1: Oxidation of TMB into TMB⁺ by G-quad-haemin complex\nMETHODOLOGY\nTo obtain the free energy of binding of haemin to G-quad, alchemical transformation of the haemin is performed, and the free energy of binding is calculated according to the thermodynamic cycle, as shown in Figure 1. The software being used is GROMACS [6].\nFigure 1: Thermodynamic cycle for calculating the binding energy of haemin to G-quad\nTOPOLOGY PREPARATION\nThe topology is prepared using the AlphaFold 3 model [7], with one DNA input (5'-GGGTGGGTGGGTGGGTC-3') and one ligand input (HEM - Haem). It is noted that haemin and haem are different, with haemin having an extra chloride ion coordinated with the iron ion (Figure 2). Since haemin and haem have very similar structures, we believe that haem is a sufficient approximation to haemin. The model generated by AlphaFold 3 with the highest confidence is taken as the topology for simulation.\nFigure 2: Structure of haemin (left) and structure of haem (right)\nTOPOLOGY VERIFICATION\nWe have visually inspected the model generated to ensure that AlphaFold 3 provided a reasonable starting topology for simulation. It was observed that the generated model follows the end-stacking binding mode reported in the literature [8], as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4.\nFigure 3: Folded G-quadruplex DNAzyme generated by AlphaFold 3\nNote that the G-quadruplex structure in the middle of the DNAzyme could be clearly seen.\nFigure 4: Folded G-quadruplex DNAzyme bound with haem\nNote that the haem stacks on top of the G-quadruplex, which is consistent with the end-stacking binding mode.\nCHOICE OF FORCE FIELD\nThe amber14sb_OL15 force field [9], [10] is chosen as the force field to be used in the simulation, as this force field has been found to better resemble experimental measurements than other force fields, which would provide a more realistic simulation [11].\nSince DMSO and haem are not \"native\" molecular species to the force field, they have to be parametrised before the simulation could proceed.\nDMSO PARAMETRISATION\nThe DMSO molecule was parametrised by the ACPYPE server [12], [13]. The topology of DMSO was submitted to the server as a .pdb file, and the server produces the .itp and .gro file required for building the topology.\nHAEM PARAMETRISATION\nSince the center of haem contains an Fe³⁺ ion, haem cannot be parametrised by the ACPYPE server as the Generalised Amber Force Field (GAFF) does not contain the Fe³⁺ ion [14]. To parametrise haem in a way that is compatible with amber14sb_OL15 force field, the Metal Center Parameter Builder (MCPB.py) is used for preparing the topology [15].\nFirst, the haem molecule is passed to MCPB.py to obtain input files for GAMESS-US [16]. Then, quantum calculations were done using GAMESS-US in order to optimise the geometry and compute the charge density. The wave function is computed using B3LYP/6-31G level of theory*, which is sufficient for haem [17]. Restrained Electrostatic Potential (RESP) [18] was applied to compute the partial charges on different atoms, and the Seminario method [19] was used to compute the bonded parameters. Lastly, the .frcmod file were converted to .itp and .gro using the LEAP program and ACPYPE.\nTOPOLOGY ASSEMBLY\nWhile DMSO and haem were parametrised in previous steps, they are not a part of the residue database. Therefore, they have to be handled separately from the G-quad.\nFirst, the .pdb file generated by AlphaFold 3 was separated into two .pdb files, one for G-quad and one for haem. The G-quad is converted into GROMACS topology using the pdb2gmx command. For the haem, the editconf command is used to convert .pdb to .gro. The .gro coordinates were manually copied to the .gro file of the G-quad .gro file. The .top file was accordingly modified to include the topology for haem and the restraints for it.\nAfter that, if DMSO is used as a co-solvent, the insert-molecules command is invoked to add DMSO molecules into the topology. solvate is used to add water to the system. The SPC/E water model [20] is used. To neutralise charges, genion is used to add ions to the topology. K⁺ ions are added to balance negative charges, and Cl⁻ ions are added to balance positive charges, as K⁺ ions are present in the experimental setup and were also shown to have the best effect on stabilising G-quad structures [21].\nSYSTEM EQUILIBRATION\nTo arrive at a reasonable starting structure and to have correct sampling during the production MD, the system must be well-equilibrated before the production MD runs. Energy minimisation was performed on the solvated structure using the steepest gradient descent method [22]. NVT equilibration was performed on the energy-minimised structure. No additional thermostats were necessary since the Langevin dynamics integrator was used for the simulation, which could also regulate the system temperature. The system temperature was set at 298K. NPT equilibration was performed on the NVT ensemble, using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat [23] to regulate the system pressure. The pressure is set to be 1 bar. The NVT and NPT equilibration were run for 100ps. The potential, temperature, pressure, and density over time were plotted, and convergence was observed in the graphs.\nPRODUCTION MD\nA total of 41 production MDs were run for each solvent configuration, in which the charge interaction of haem is gradually decoupled first, and then the Lennard-Jones potentials are also gradually decoupled. This allows us to obtain the ∂H/∂λ curve, which can then be used to obtain ΔG using the Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) method [24].\nThe charge lambdas are first decoupled in steps of 0.05 per iteration, and after the charge interactions are decoupled, the Lennard-Jones potentials are decoupled in steps of 0.05 per iteration. To ensure sufficient ensemble sampling at the specified lambda values, 2.5ns of the simulation was run for each combination of lambda, which is around two times what is deemed adequate [25]. The free energy was obtained from ∂H/∂λ using bar.\nCALCULATION OF ΔG OF G-QUAD-HAEM BOND\nTo calculate the ΔG of haem binding to G-quad, one may refer to the thermodynamic cycle outlined in Figure 1. Two separate simulations were set up, one with G-quad bounded with haem and another with haem only. Two systems were solvated in the same DMSO/water mixture concentration, and haem was alchemically transformed through the process outlined above.  \nRESULTS\nThe simulation results are summarised below. ΔG are given in kJ/mol and the +/- values represent the standard deviation of ΔG.\nDMSO concentration (v/v) % ΔG in G-quad-haem ΔG in haem only ΔG binding 0 2598.74 +/- 15.45 2633.05 +/- 5.10 34.41 +/- 16.27 5 2577.23 +/- 3.00 2592.05 +/- 7.48 14.82 +/- 8.06 10 2577.19 +/- 11.07 2615.68 +/- 2.05 38.49 +/- 11.26 15 2562.85 +/- 4.34 2604.41 +/- 2.51 41.56 +/- 5.01 20 2510.37 +/- 17.08 2626.85 +/- 1.66 116.48 +/- 17.16 25 2543.50 +/- 11.67 2568.09 +/- 2.83 24.59 +/- 12.01 30 2482.45 +/- 9.99 2600.48 +/- 3.56 118.03 +/- 10.61 35 2492.22 +/- 13.88 2594.15 +/- 5.82 101.93 +/- 15.05 40 2564.71 +/- 22.22 2586.21 +/- 3.90 21.50 +/- 22.56 45 2479.50 +/- 18.14 2558.66 +/- 3.21 79.16 +/- 18.42 50 2509.47 +/- 15.19 2524.21 +/- 9.77 14.74 +/- 18.06\nTo visualise the results, the free energies are plotted against DMSO concentration (v/v) %, as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6.\nFigure 5: Change in free energy (ΔG) of decoupling of haem in G-quad-haem and haem only\nFigure 6: Change in free energy (ΔG) of binding of haem in G-quad-haem\nDISCUSSIONS\nFrom Figure 5, we could observe that the free energy change of decoupling of haem only in solvent decreases as DMSO concentration increases. This is in agreement with the literature, where the solubility of haemin increases as DMSO concentration increases. In Figure 6, we observed a general trend of increasing binding energy of haem to G-quad, indicating a prediction of decreasing binding affinity to G-quad as the DMSO concentration increases.\nSome data points do not follow the trend: the binding energies at 25% and 40% DMSO concentration (v/v). We believe this is due to the change in G-quad conformation during the simulation, which skewed the free energy values. Through the inspection of RMSD value over time of simulations (see Supporting Information) and comparing with the non-perturbed simulation (λ = 0), we conclude that the G-quadruplex DNAzyme has changed conformation in some of the simulations, leading to inaccurate free energy values. Potential solutions are discussed below.\nWe have also noticed that the standard deviations of the change in free energy for G-quad-haem decoupling are large. Upon inspection of the gmx bar output, we noticed that the relative entropies between some of the lambdas were significant, indicating inadequate phase space sampling. This suggests the need for more sampling in those intervals.\nLIMITATIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nWhile the simulations have provided valuable insights in terms of the affinity of haem to G-quad, we are also aware of the following limitations and uncertainties.\nINABILITY TO SIMULATE PEROXIDASE ACTIVITY OF G-QUAD-HAEM IN VARIOUS SOLVENT MIXTURES\nWhile molecular dynamics simulations may provide information about the binding affinity between G-quad and haem, they cannot provide information on the peroxidase activity of G-quad-haemin due to their inability to simulate bond breaking and forming, which are the basis of chemical reactions. Such processes would lead to topology modifications, which is impossible in pure molecular mechanics simulations. Also, in molecular mechanics simulations, quantum effects on the electrons are neglected, and molecules are assumed to be at the ground state. In contrast, most reactions require electrons to be excited or exchange electrons between different species. Resolving such issues would demand the model to take quantum effects into account. We suggest that quantum mechanics/ molecular mechanics (QM/MM) hybrid simulations may be able to fill this gap.  \nUNRESTRAINED G-QUAD SKEWS FREE ENERGY VALUES\nUpon inspection of the G-quad-haem structure generated by the AlphaFold 3 model, we noticed that there are hand-like structures formed by the last two nucleotides of the G-quad sequence (TC-3') that seem to hold onto the haem ligand and keep it in place. However, as the interaction between haem and the surroundings was decoupled, the interactions between haem and the hand region weakened, which may cause the hand region to wiggle freely. This increases the number of possible microstates in the system, increasing the entropy and leading to skewed free energy values. This may be solved by \"confine and release\" free energy simulations, which have been proposed in literature [26].\nBINDING AFFINITY MAY NOT BE A UNIVERSAL INDICATOR TO G-QUAD-HAEMIN PEROXIDASE ACTIVITY\nWhile there was literature suggesting that the binding affinity of haemin to G-quad may be a predictor for the peroxidase activity of the G-quad-haemin DNAzyme [8], we have also found literature supporting the opposing view [27]. Hence, the hypothesis that the free energy of binding between G-quad and haemin is a predictor for peroxidase activity may not be universally true.\nG-QUAD-HAEM ACTIVITY MAY NOT BE THE MOST CRUCIAL FACTOR AFFECTING REACTION RATE\nAlthough we focused on evaluating the stability of the G-quad-haem complex in different solvent mixtures, one must remember that the ultimate goal for optimising solvent mixture is to maximise the reaction rates, such that the test kit develops a more evident colour change more rapidly. The stability of the G-quad-haem complex only evaluated the catalyst in the reaction, and the effects of solvents on the reactants' stability may need to be accounted for in the simulations. The solvent may increase the reaction rate by affecting the stability of intermediate and final products and vice versa [28]. It is suggested that the whole reaction, including its intermediary products, may be qualitatively evaluated in terms of their stability before confirming whether the increased or decreased stability of G-quad-haem matters for the reaction.\nCONCLUSION\nDespite the presence of some inaccuracies due to the factors outlined above, our preliminary modelling results indicate a promising potential that the binding energy of haem to G-quad is the lowest in fully aqueous solutions. This exciting discovery could pave the way for a new method to predict G-quad-haem complex catalytic capability in different solutions, a possibility that can be further explored in the lab.\nTo help future iGEM teams in modelling molecular systems involving the haem residue, we have uploaded the parametrised haem topology for other teams to use.\nREFERENCES\n 1.

        "content": "We believe that our team has made the following contributions to the iGEM community.\nDESIGN OF POSITIVE CONTROL DNA FRAGMENT\nMany iGEM teams, including us, rely on external sponsorships and funds from the university. We understand that most teams are very short on funds and, thus, cannot replace expired items at will. Our positive control fragments allow teams to assay the functionality and activity of the restriction enzymes, saving money from using them to replace expired but functional enzymes and saving time from just hoping that the expired enzymes would work. The unique property of the positive control fragment is that it has many restriction sites in a short sequence, resulting in the effective use of dNTPs for building DNA fragments.\nUSE OF NICKASE FOR PRODUCING SHORT SSDNA FRAGMENTS FROM RCA\nIn our original design, we planned to enhance the production speed of G-quadruplex DNAzyme (G-quad) and, therefore, colour change by cleaving the primer-G-quad phosphodiester bond on the product strand, freeing the DNAzyme and the primer for more reactions. However, the attempt with 13PD1 DNAzyme failed for us (see DNA-Cleaving DNAzymes Test). This has forced us to think innovatively, and we turned to the enzymes currently in the reaction mix, nickase. By leveraging the ability of nickase to cleave only one strand, we can achieve amplification of RCA initiation, hopefully producing faster results for our kit.\nDEVELOPMENT OF ROBUST SSDNA CIRCULARISATION PROTOCOL\nAt the heart of our project lies RCA, which directly controls the production of G-quad, leading to visible colour change. RCA relies on circular ssDNA templates, which are very expensive if they were to be synthesised by companies. Our team also could not afford to synthesise circular ssDNA, so we turned to the literature and found a protocol for ssDNA circularisation with limited success. We encountered false positives when performing RCA due to the residual scaffold hybridised to the circularised template, acting as a perfect primer for RCA. We then modified the protocol with the use of exonuclease III to also remove the circularised RCA template with RCA scaffold hybridised to it. With exonuclease III, we have not re-encountered the problem of false positives. Hence, we believe this modified circularisation is robust, allowing future iGEM teams to produce circular ssDNA for their experiments at a low cost.  \nPARAMETRISATION OF HAEM RESIDUE IN ALPHAFOLD 3 FOR GROMACS SIMULATIONS\nDuring modelling, our most prominent difficulty was the parametrisation of haem residue for GROMACS simulations. Since the haem residue contains iron (III) ions, which were not present in ordinary force fields, they provided significant hurdles during parametrisation, as quantum calculations are necessary. Installing quantum chemistry packages is time-consuming, and the calculations required to obtain the parameters are lengthy and easily consume days. In light of the problems we have encountered along the way, and considering the popularity of the AlphaFold 3 model, we decided to share the haem topology model with the synthetic biology community, allowing future teams to perform simulations containing the haem residue quickly. The .itp topology file is available for download here."
