        "content": "ResiSense is a project that aims to provide a cheaper and faster alternative to detecting antibiotic-resistant pathogens via DNA sensing.\nPROBLEM BACKGROUND\nANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE PREVALENCE\nAntibiotic resistance is a growing problem in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared antibiotic resistance as one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development ‚§¥Ô∏è. The misuse and overuse of antibiotics have led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Previously manageable infections resurface as untreatable diseases as the effectiveness of last-resort drugs are compromised, leading to increased mortality rates and healthcare costs. Antibiotic resistance directly caused 1.27 million deaths and contributed to 4.95 million deaths in total in 2019 ‚§¥Ô∏è, and this figure is projected to rise to 10 million by 2050 if no action is taken ‚§¥Ô∏è.\nCURRENT METHODS\nThe current methods for detecting antibiotic-resistant pathogens are expensive and time-consuming, limiting its accessibility and potential utility ‚§µÔ∏è. A cheaper, faster, and simpler technology is needed.\nOUR SOLUTION\nWe are developing a point-of-care test kit, ResiSense, for more efficient diagnosis, using cell-free synthetic biology. This proposed testing system consists of three parts: target gene extraction, rolling circle amplification (RCA) ‚§¥Ô∏è, and signal expression. Bacterial DNA is released following cell lysis before a snippet of the target gene responsible for antibiotic resistance is cut using a pair of restriction enzymes and nickase. Œ¶-29 polymerase aids in releasing the target gene as ss-DNA. This target gene serves as a primer and triggers the formation of peroxidase-mimicking (G-quadruplex) DNAzymes through RCA to cause a color change in the solution, indicating the presence of antibiotic-resistant genes in bacteria. Our aim is to create a versatile, easily programmable system that can detect various antibiotic resistance genes, starting with those related to Klebsiella pneumonia, which is a common intestinal bacterium that showed elevated resistance levels against critical antibiotics ‚§¥Ô∏è.\nEXPECTED RESULTS\nTesting Method Limitations Time Cost (USD) MIC Long incubation time 24h 9.18 PCR Requires specific machines and trained personnel 50m 34.18 Sequencing Requires trained personnel and specilised software 24h 97.52 MALDI-TOF MS Requires expensive equipment and trained personnel 30m 0.1 ResiSense (Projected) Under development 93m 5.22\nOur solution aims to address the problems of lengthy culturing, the need for specilised machines and trained personnel by offering a cheaper, quicker, and simpler technology. We are confident that the innovation will bring a great impact on different aspects."

Maybe use this space to broadly introduce the page.\nTHIS IS HOME\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Quid, si non modo utilitatem tibi nullam afferet, sed iacturae rei familiaris erunt faciendae, labores suscipiendi, adeundum vitae periculum? Naturalem enim appetitionem, quam vocant o)rmh)n, itemque officium, ipsam etiam virtutem tuentem volunt esse earum rerum, quae secundum naturam sunt. Ego autem existimo, si honestum esse aliquid ostendero, quod sit ipsum vi sua propter seque expetendum, iacere vestra omnia. Quam ob rem turpe putandum est, non dico dolere-nam id quidem est interdum necesse-, sed saxum illud Lemnium clamore Philocteteo funestare, Quod eiulatu, questu, gemitu, fremitibus Resonando mutum flebiles voces refert. Quae dici eadem de ceteris virtutibus possunt, quarum omnium fundamenta vos in voluptate tamquam in aqua ponitis. Cui vero in voluptate summum bonum est, huic omnia sensu, non ratione sunt iudicanda, eaque dicenda optima, quae sint suavissima. Hic homo severus luxuriam ipsam per se reprehendendam non putat, et hercule, Torquate, ut verum loquamur, si summum bonum voluptas est, rectissime non putat. Duo Reges: constructio interrete. In quibus hoc primum est in quo admirer, cur in gravissimis rebus non delectet eos sermo patrius, cum idem fabellas Latinas ad verbum e Graecis expressas non inviti legant. Iam quae corporis sunt, ea nec auctoritatem cum animi partibus, comparandam et cognitionem habent faciliorem. Omnium autem eorum commodorum, quibus non illi plus tribuunt, qui illa bona esse dicunt, quam Zeno, qui negat, longe praestantissimum esse, quod honestum esset atque laudabile. Quibus rebus intellegitur nec timiditatem ignaviamque vituperari nec fortitudinem patientiamque laudari suo nomine, sed illas reici, quia dolorem pariant, has optari, quia voluptatem. Stoici restant, ei quidem non unam aliquam aut alteram rem a nobis, sed totam ad se nostram philosophiam transtulerunt; Quis enim confidit semper sibi illud stabile et firmum permansurum, quod fragile et caducum sit? Nec vero dico eorum metum mortis, qui, quia privari se vitae bonis arbitrentur, aut quia quasdam post mortem formidines extimescant, aut si metuant, ne cum dolore moriantur, idcirco mortem fugiant; Et tamen vide, ne, si ego non intellegam quid Epicurus loquatur, cum Graece, ut videor, luculenter sciam, sit aliqua culpa eius, qui ita loquatur, ut non intellegatur.\nEt hi quidem ita non sola virtute finem bonorum contineri putant, ut rebus tamen omnibus virtutem anteponant; Non elogia monimentorum id significant, velut hoc ad portam: Hunc unum plurimae consentiunt gentes populi primarium fuisse virum. Quin ne bestiae quidem, quas delectationis causa concludimus, cum copiosius alantur, quam si essent liberae, facile patiuntur sese contineri motusque solutos et vagos a natura sibi tributos requirunt. Ea, quae dialectici nunc tradunt et docent, nonne ab illis instituta sunt aut inventa sunt? Huic Epicurus praecentet, si potest, cui e viperino morsu venae viscerum Veneno inbutae taetros cruciatus cient! Sic Epicurus: Philocteta, st! brevis dolor. Primum non saepe, deinde quae est ista relaxatio, cum et praeteriti doloris memoria recens est et futuri atque inpendentis torquet timor? Non enim actionis aut officii ratio impellit ad ea, quae secundum naturam sunt, petenda, sed ab iis et appetitio et actio commovetur. Inest in eadem explicatione naturae insatiabilis quaedam e cognoscendis rebus voluptas,in qua una confectis rebus necessariis vacui negotiis honeste ac liberaliter possimus vivere. Bonum ipsum etiam quid esset, fortasse, si opus fuisset, definisses aut quod esset natura adpetendum aut quod prodesset aut quod iuvaret aut quod liberet modo. In omni enim animante est summum aliquid atque optimum, ut in equis, in canibus, quibus tamen et dolore vacare opus est et valere; Quare istam quoque aggredere tractatam praesertim et ab aliis et a te ipso saepe, ut tibi deesse non possit oratio. Et hi quidem ita non sola virtute finem bonorum contineri putant, ut rebus tamen omnibus virtutem anteponant; Ac tamen, ne cui loco non videatur esse responsum, pauca etiam nunc dicam ad reliquam orationem tuam. Quodsi esset in voluptate summum bonum, ut dicitis, optabile esset maxima in voluptate nullo intervallo interiecto dies noctesque versari, cum omnes sensus dulcedine omni quasi perfusi moverentur. Nam bonum ex quo appellatum sit, nescio, praepositum ex eo credo, quod praeponatur aliis. Bona autem corporis huic sunt, quod posterius posui, similiora.\nA villa enim, credo, et: Si ibi te esse scissem, ad te ipse venissem. Elicerem ex te cogeremque, ut responderes, nisi vererer ne Herculem ipsum ea, quae pro salute gentium summo labore gessisset, voluptatis causa gessisse diceres. Sed tamen omne, quod de re bona dilucide dicitur, mihi praeclare dici videtur. Cum enim superiores, e quibus planissime Polemo, secundum naturam vivere summum bonum esse dixissent, his verbis tria significari Stoici dicunt, unum eius modi, vivere adhibentem scientiam earum rerum, quae natura evenirent. Aderamus nos quidem adolescentes, sed multi amplissimi viri, quorum nemo censuit plus Fadiae dandum, quam posset ad eam lege Voconia pervenire. Nam illud quidem adduci vix possum, ut ea, quae senserit ille, tibi non vera videantur. Quamquam ex omnibus philosophis Stoici plurima novaverunt, Zenoque, eorum princeps, non tam rerum inventor fuit quam verborum novorum. Quid in isto egregio tuo officio et tanta fide-sic enim existimo-ad corpus refers?"

        "content": "Integrated human practice refers to the collaboration with various parties to further our project.\nOVERVIEW\nOur team emphasises the connection of our project design with the actual needs of society. In this regard, we interacted with several experts with the aim of inventing a product that provides maximum impact to society and matches the requirements of various stakeholders.\nINTERVIEWS\nPROBE VECTOR SELECTION\nPROFESSOR MARGARET IP\nProfessor Ip is the Chairperson of the Department of Microbiology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. She is an expert in Clinical Microbiology and Infection and is a renowned member of various antibiotics-related committees.¬†\nIn the interview with Prof Margaret Ip, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the current situation of antibiotic resistance in Hong Kong and the corresponding detection methods.\nCURRENT METHODS\nProf Ip explained that the most common way to detect antibiotic resistance genes is through DNA sequencing with protein analysis. However, this method is expensive, especially in developing countries. It requires a lab expert and a large machine to analyse.\nSENSITIVITY AND STABILITY\nProf Ip suggested that DNA is more stable and sensitive than detecting proteins or toxins produced by bacteria alone. She recommended that we detect multiple genes in one test for the sake of sensitivity and accuracy due to the occurrence of multiple genes in bacteria.\nIMPLICATIONS\nWe plan to detect related DNA to infer antibiotic resistance in targeted bacteria. Proteins and toxins will be our alternative if the DNA sensing approach does not work in our web lab. As per Prof Ip's emphasis, our point-of-care device should be cheaper and faster than DNA sequencing techniques currently used.¬†\nPOINT-OF-CARE KIT DESIGN\nPROFESSOR STEPHEN TSUI\nProfessor Tsui is a renowned expert in the field of Biomedical Sciences and the director of the Hong Kong Bioinformatics Centre and the Centre for Microbial Genomics and Proteomics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\nIn the interview with Prof Tsui, we discussed the feasibility and efficiency of our point-of-care (POC) kit and analysed the current market.\nSPECIFICITY AND ACCURACY\nProf Tsui pointed out that impurities could lead to significant problems in the accuracy and sensitivity of our RCA step. He suggested that we implement purification steps and controls in our test to improve the reliability of the results.\nTARGETED GROUP\nProf Tsui suggested that our project design tends to be qualitative, rather than quantitative, like MIC. He explained that a qualitative approach might not be ideal for clinical use, as doctors may be unable to determine the result and take appropriate actions based on it. Therefore, he recommended that we decide on how to show the colorimetric result in the last step, such as using a laptop with the POC device to detect the color change quantitatively, or employ a COVID RAT-like approach.\nMARKET\nProf Tsui pointed out that the most popular and mature approaches to detect antibiotic-resistant genes nowadays in developed countries include MIC, DNA sequencing, and real-time PCR plus single-point mutation enzymes. However, these techniques are not common in developing countries, which means we could be more competitive if we target them.\nIMPLICATIONS\nProf Tsui's advice will help us improve the reliability and accuracy of our POC kit. We will consider his suggestions on employing a qualitative approach and focusing on a target group to make our product more competitive in the market.\nANTIBIOTIC USE IN HOSPITALS AND PUBLIC AWARENESS\nDOCTOR PIERRE CHAN\nDoctor Pierre Chan is a medical practitioner and a former legislative counsellor seated as the representative for the medical functional constituency in Hong Kong.\nIn our discussion with Dr Chan, we gained insights into the use of antibiotics in hospitals and public awareness of antibiotics.\nHOSPITAL PROCEDURE\nDr Chan explained that in severe cases, doctors usually use empirical antibiotics based on international guidelines to save lives instead of finding the most appropriate drugs. However, in non-severe cases, doctors check the type of bacteria involved in the infection. He also mentioned that several samples such as urine, blood, and stool are collected from patients, but only 2-3 samples usually show positive results. It is crucial to consider the type of samples collected for analysis. Furthermore, hospitals usually do not recheck the results due to time and manpower constraints, and a full analysis takes 1-2 days.\nPUBLIC AWARENESS\nDr Chan believes that the problem of antibiotic resistance is more prevalent in the community than in hospitals. He cited the misuse of antibiotics in the agricultural industry as an example of how the abuse of these drugs is not regulated. Although public awareness about antibiotics is not low in Hong Kong, Dr Chan pointed out that some people buy restricted drugs, including antibiotics, without a doctor's prescription. Our discussion highlighted the need for educational events to address this issue. It is essential to consider different approaches to education to ensure that the public is well-informed about the importance of responsible use of antibiotics.\nIMPLICATIONS\nOur discussion with Dr Chan shed light on the use of antibiotics in hospitals and the public awareness about antibiotics. We will focus our point-of-care kit for screening speed. We will also consider his insights while developing our educational events to ensure that the public is well-informed about the importance of responsible use of antibiotics."
