# 🧬 [ResiSense.github.io](https://ResiSense.github.io)
This is an alpha draft version of the ResiSense site, temporarily hosted using Github pages. It will eventually be pushed to the [iGEM](https://igem.org/) servers (I think).  
Please note that this repository can be accessed in many locations, but the one hosted on [Github](https://github.com/ResiSense/ResiSense.github.io) should always be regarded as the authoritative version.
