    <h2>Cell Lysis: SDS Treatment</h2>

        As described in our <a href="https://2024.igem.wiki/hongkong-cuhk/proof
">Proof of Concept</a>
        , we selected SDS as a method to lyse our cells. Figure 1 shows the results
        of our SDS treatment of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the form of microscopy pictures. We selected an area in
        both pictures and magnified the selected area for comparison. On the left picture, we are able to observe more
        intact cells, marked in red circles, compared to the picture on the right. This indicates that the lysis of
        E.coli using SDS under room temperature is successful. To further verify this method quantitatively, more robust
        luciferase-based tests are planned to be done in the future.

    <h2>Target Gene Extraction: Nt.BsmAI/HhaI-LSDA</h2>
    <img src="/assets/result/Figure 2.png">
    <div class="figure-label">Figure 2</div>

    <div class="section-text">
        In this project, we extract our primer, which will then be used in downstream reactions, through LSDA. This
        process involves the nicking and cutting of pSB1C3-KPC-2-surrogate by Nt.BsmAI and HhaI. As illustrated in our
        <a href="https://2024.igem.wiki/hongkong-cuhk/proof
">Proof of Concept</a>
        , this process is expected to amplify a 32 nt ssDNA from the pSB1C3-KPC-2-surrogate plasmid, along with 724 and
        534 nt ssDNA strands as the side products of this LSDA process. Figure 2 shows that our LSDA reaction has
        successfully generated both the 724 and 534 nt ssDNA. However, we are unable to detect the 32 nt primer,
        potentially due to its smaller size. To further validate this method, we will combine this reaction with RCA to
        determine if it can produce a positive RCA result.

        <div class="white-spaces"></div>
        Note that In this preliminary experiment, we performed 45 minutes digestion, which was then followed by the
        incubation with phi29 for an extra 15 minutes in order to prevent the displaced ssDNA from phi29 exonuclease
        activity. However, this two-step reaction is unnecessary in the target gene extraction-RCA coupling since the
        extracted primer will immediately bind to the RCA template.

    <h2>Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA)</h2>
    <h3 class="section-subtitle">RCA in rCutSmart</h3>
    <img src="/assets/result/Figure 3.png">
    <div class="figure-label">Figure 3</div>

    <div class="section-text">
        To facilitate the coupling of the target gene extraction and the RCA process, the reaction mixture must be
        compatible for both reactions. Therefore, we tested whether phi29 is compatible with the rCutSmart buffer, which
        is the primary buffer for Nt.BsmAI and HhaI. Figure 3 demonstrated that the RCA process can be fully performed
        in the rCutSmart buffer. This is indicated by the presence of smearing bands, with a size larger than the 10,000
        bp DNA ladder, in both “10X Reaction Buffer” and “rCutSmart Buffer” lanes. The smearing bands are expected due
        to the continuous amplification by RCA and generation of variable-length amplification products. Further
        verification is also obtained by the result of experiment E2.3 in <a

    <h3 class="section-subtitle">Third-generation RCA</h3>
    <img src="/assets/result/Figure 4.png">
    <div class="figure-label">Figure 4</div>

    <div class="section-text">
        We have also verified both our RCA template circularisation and our RCA methods. With our third-generation RCA
        template (<a href="https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K5041004">BBa_K5041004</a>)
        , we are able to obtain satisfactory results for our RCA.
        <br>
        <div class="white-spaces"></div>
        In figure 4, lanes (1)-(4) included both the third-generation (v3) template (treated with Exonuclease I and III)
        and the RCA primer (Integrated DNA Technologies), mixed with the Nt.BsmAI nicking endonuclease (New England
        Biolabs). The template amounts were 1 ng, 2 ng, 4 ng, and 8 ng, respectively. Lane (5) contained the same
        template and RCA primer but without Nt.BsmAI, while lane (6) had only the third-generation template (treated
        with Exonuclease I and III), with neither the primer nor Nt.BsmAI.
        <br>
        <div class="white-spaces"></div>
        Lanes (1)-(4) displayed a smearing band throughout, indicating successful RCA and effective cutting by Nt.BsmAI,
        with band intensity increasing alongside the template amounts. Lane (5) showed a smearing band concentrated at
        sizes larger than 10,000 bp, suggesting successful RCA in that sample. In contrast, lane (6) had no detected
        band, confirming that we obtained true negative results from this circularization method.

    <h2>Signal Expression: G-Quadruplex DNAzyme Assay</h2>

    <img src="/assets/result/Figure 5.png">
    <div class="figure-label">Figure 5</div>

    <div class="section-text">
        To verify our project mechanism, we coupled the RCA results we obtained in figure 4 for G-Quadruplex assay. As
        shown in figure 5, both samples (1) and (2) exhibited a similar slight colour change to blue, while sample (3)
        and (4) had a stronger colour change. Sample (5) had similar colour change as (1), while sample (6) did not
        produce observable blue colour. The last shown sample was a positive control reaction mixture using
        IDT-synthesised G-Quadruplex DNAzyme (<a href="https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K5041001">BBa_K5041001</a>)
        . These results indicate that we have successfully coupled our third-generation RCA reaction with the
        G-Quadruplex assay.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="section-text">
        We have individually tested the cell lysis and target gene extraction, and coupled the RCA reaction with the
        G-Quadruplex DNAzyme assay. The experimental results support the claim that the project is feasible and the
        mechanism is valid. To further support our claim, more experiments are planned to confirm the coupling of all
        reactions.

    <h2>Additional Key Information</h2>
    <div class="section-text">
        All processes in our detection system are designed to be completed at room temperature. While we have confirmed
        that most reactions can occur at 37°C or below, we primarily performed the experiments at the recommended
        optimal temperature for each enzyme for the ease of detection and so validation of concept. Further optimization
        on the individual steps are needed to evaluate the product performance at room temperature. In the future, we
        are also planning to characterise our detection system on its sensitivity and specificity.
