Integrated human practices refer to the collaborations with various parties with aims of furthering our project.  

# Overview

Our team, Resisense, is deeply committed to addressing the critical needs of our community and the world at large. To secure our project's success, we conducted extensive human practice interviews to understand the intricate details of detecting antibiotic resistance genes and the points of concern of implementing our kits in practice.  

We are acutely aware that antibiotic resistance is not just a complex issue but also a pressing one. Our human practice research is far from a mere formality but the cornerstone of our **probe selection**, **kit design**, **target market identification**, and **education workshop design**.  

***[Here need an illustration]***  

Our integrated human practice consists of 4 steps: **literature review and brainstorm**, **implementation**, **expert consultations**, and **project modification**. We heavily emphasises the connection of our project design with the **actual needs of society**. In this regard, we consulted numerous experts to invent a product that provides maximum impact to society and matches the requirements of various stakeholders.  

It is with sincerity that we say the success of our project is indebted to our human practice interviews. By investing time and effort into these conversations, the invaluable knowledge and broad perspectives we gathered enriched our project greatly, particularly in our wet lab and education events.  

# Interviews

> ## Probe Vector Selection
> 
> ### Professor Margaret Ip
> ![Portrait of Professor Margaret Ip](/assets/humans/margaret%20ip%20full-Enhanced-SR%20transparent.png)  
> [Professor Ip](https://www.med.cuhk.edu.hk/staff/professor-margaret-ip) is the Chairperson of the [Department of Microbiology](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/med/mic) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. She is an expert in Clinical Microbiology and Infection and is a renowned member of various antibiotics-related committees.  
> <span class="--human-card-above"></span>  
>
> In the interview with Prof Margaret Ip, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the current situation of antibiotic resistance in Hong Kong and the corresponding detection methods.  
> 
> #### Current Methods
> Prof Ip explained that the most common way to detect antibiotic resistance genes is through **DNA sequencing with protein analysis**. However, this method is **expensive**, especially in developing countries. It requires a lab expert and a large machine to analyse.  
>
> #### Sensitivity and Stability
> Prof Ip suggested that **DNA is more stable and sensitive** than detecting proteins or toxins produced by bacteria alone. She recommended that we **detect multiple genes** in one test for the sake of sensitivity and accuracy due to the occurrence of multiple genes in bacteria.
>
> #### Implications
> We plan to **detect related DNA to infer antibiotic resistance** in targeted bacteria. Proteins and toxins will be our alternative if the DNA sensing approach does not work in our web lab. As per Prof Ip's emphasis, our point-of-care device should be **cheaper and faster** than DNA sequencing techniques currently used.  

> ## Science Communication and Public Engagement
>
> ### Doctor Helen Ma
> ![Portrait of Doctor Helen Ma](/assets/humans/helen%20ma-Enhanced-SR%20transparent.png)  
> [Doctor Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helen-ma-b86715199) is the science education project manager at the [Office of University General Education](https://www.oge.cuhk.edu.hk) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and an RTHK television science programme host. She is an experienced science communicator, with a background in *Streptococcus pneumoniae* antibiotic resistance research in her post-graduate degree.  
> <span class="--human-card-above"></span>
>
> In the interview with Dr Ma, we consulted her on the public's attitude towards antibiotics and the best practices to effective science communication.  
>
> #### General Public's Understanding
> Dr Ma expressed that while the general public is getting more educated on the issue of antibiotic resistance, **not all people will take action to impede the spread of resistance**. For instance, since medicine is often considered "harmful" and damaging to the body in the view of Hong Kong people, and antibiotics are only administered when the symptoms are severe, people often choose **not to complete their antibiotic prescription**. The concept of antibiotic resistance is **vague and distant to the general public**, giving them low motivation to take the right action.  
>
> #### Effective Science Communication
> Dr Ma suggested that when describing abstract ideas to people, especially the older generation, we need to **emphasise how it will directly affect them** instead of how it works. For instance, instead of explaining how the leak of antibiotics leads to the development of resistance, we should directly tell them that their medicine **will not work next time** if they don’t complete their prescription and that doctors will eventually run out of effective medication. It is more effective to convince them by **illustrating how they will be directly affected** instead of lecturing them on the mechanisms and causal relationships.  

> ## Point-of-care Kit Design
>
> ### Professor Stephen Tsui
> ![Portrait of Professor Stephen Tsui](/assets/humans/stephen%20tsui%20full-Enhanced-SR%20transparent.png)  
> [Professor Tsui](https://www2.sbs.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/prof-tsui-kwok-wing-stephen) is a renowned expert in the field of Biomedical Sciences and the director of the [Hong Kong Bioinformatics Centre](http://www.hkbic.cuhk.edu.hk/) and the Centre for Microbial Genomics and Proteomics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.  
> <span class="--human-card-above"></span>
>
> In the interview with Prof Tsui, we discussed the feasibility and efficiency of our point-of-care (POC) kit and analysed the current market.
>
> #### Specificity and Accuracy
> Prof Tsui pointed out that impurities could lead to significant problems in the accuracy and sensitivity of our RCA step. He suggested that we implement **purification steps** and **controls** in our test to improve the reliability of the results.
>
> #### Targeted Group
> Prof Tsui suggested that our project design tends to be qualitative, rather than quantitative, like MIC. He explained that **a qualitative approach might not be ideal for clinical use**, as doctors may be unable to determine the result and take appropriate actions based on it. Therefore, he recommended that we decide on how to show the colorimetric result in the last step, such as using a laptop with the POC device to **detect the color change quantitatively**, or employ a COVID RAT-like approach.
>
> #### Market
> Prof Tsui pointed out that the most popular and mature approaches to detect antibiotic-resistant genes nowadays in developed countries include MIC, DNA sequencing, and real-time PCR plus single-point mutation enzymes. However, these techniques are not common in developing countries, which means we could be more competitive if we target them.
>
> #### Implications
> Prof Tsui's advice will help us improve the **reliability and accuracy** of our POC kit. We will consider his suggestions on **employing a qualitative approach** and **focusing on a target group** to make our product more competitive in the market.

> ## Antibiotic Use in Hospitals and Public Awareness
>
> ### Doctor Pierre Chan
> ![Portrait of Doctor Pierre Chan](/assets/humans/pierre%20chan%20full-Enhanced-SR%20transprent.png)  
> [Doctor Pierre Chan](https://www.drchanpierre.org/about-me) is a medical practitioner and a former legislative counsellor seated as the representative for the medical functional constituency in Hong Kong.  
> <span class="--human-card-above"></span>
>
> In our discussion with Dr Chan, we gained insights into the use of antibiotics in hospitals and public awareness of antibiotics.
>
> #### Hospital Procedure
> Dr Chan explained that in severe cases, doctors usually use **empirical antibiotics** based on international guidelines to save lives instead of finding the most appropriate drugs. However, in non-severe cases, doctors check the type of bacteria involved in the infection. He also mentioned that several samples such as urine, blood, and stool are collected from patients, but only 2-3 samples usually show positive results. **It is crucial to consider the type of samples collected for analysis.** Furthermore, **hospitals usually do not recheck the results due to time and manpower constraints**, and **a full analysis takes 1-2 days**.  
>
> #### Public Awareness
> Dr Chan believes that the problem of antibiotic resistance is more **prevalent in the community** than in hospitals. He cited the misuse of antibiotics in the agricultural industry as an example of how **the abuse of these drugs is not regulated**. Although public awareness about antibiotics is not low in Hong Kong, Dr Chan pointed out that **some people buy restricted drugs, including antibiotics, without a doctor's prescription**. Our discussion highlighted the need for educational events to address this issue. It is essential to consider different approaches to education to ensure that the public is well-informed about the importance of responsible use of antibiotics.
>
> #### Implications
> Our discussion with Dr Chan shed light on the **use of antibiotics in hospitals** and the **public awareness about antibiotics**. We will focus our point-of-care kit for screening speed. We will also consider his insights while developing our educational events to ensure that the public is well-informed about the importance of responsible use of antibiotics.

> ## Biotechnology Education in Local Secondary Schools
>
> ### Dr Victor Lau
> ![Portrait of Doctor Victor Lau](/assets/humans/victor%20lau-Enhanced-SR%20transparent.png)  
> [Doctor Victor Lau](https://www.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/cri/faculty/dr-lau-kwok-chi-victor) is the assistant dean of the [Department of Curriculum and Instruction](https://www.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/cri) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a consultant for the science education curriculum in Hong Kong.  
> <span class="--human-card-above"></span>
>
> In our discussion with Dr Lau, we gained insights in the contemporary shortcomings of biotechnology education in local secondary schools.  
>
> #### Biotech Development in Local Secondary Schools
> As local students, we have experienced Hong Kong’s science education and its **flaws**. Biotechnology is currently an elective topic in the biology curriculum, covering fundamental theories like PCR and gel electrophoresis. However, as mentioned by Dr Lau, it is **not cost-efficient for a secondary school** to invest in a complete set of biotechnology lab equipment solely for teaching a few chapters. Targeting this problem, [Hong Kong Amgen Biotech Experience (ABEHK)](https://abehk.fed.cuhk.edu.hk), an organization co-directed by Dr Lau, is supporting local schools by **renting out equipment like thermocyclers and pipettes** to schools and **sending student ambassadors** to provide hands-on experience to secondary school students, similar to typical iGEM secondary school experience workshops. 
>
> #### Education on Antibiotic Resistance
> Dr Lau suggested **focusing more on antibiotic resistance in our education workshops**. He pointed out many misconceptions on this matter, not only among students but also among the general public. The most common one is that resistant bacteria only come from the use of antibiotics. He also highlighted **a trend of medical malpractice** where local clinics are **not giving the full antibiotic dose to cut costs**, leading to resistant bacteria development. Although the government has distributed posters and leaflets on this topic, **the message is not well-absorbed**. Dr Lau suggested using **simple interactive models** assembled with simple stationery like paper clips and magnets to explain relevant concepts to the public in an interactive way over a verbal-only approach.  
>
> #### Implications
> We pointed out that one of the most common issues secondary school students face is that they need to **troubleshoot experiments**. Workshops like those provided by ABE allow students to understand better the theory and, hence, the errors that led to their failures. After learning about ABE and its mission, we planned to **build upon their workshops** and design one of our own, specifically with material to **teach students how to troubleshoot**.
