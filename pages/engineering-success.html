        Due to the inability of the first-generation (v1) RCA-GQ coupling to produce a strong result (see E2.3), we
        redesigned our template to promote increased amplification of the G-Quadruplex DNAzyme during the RCA process,
        aiming to as well increase the signal expression level in our G-Quadruplex DNAzyme assay. Our new
        second-generation (v2) RCA template is a 86 bp long ssDNA with a phosphate group at the 5’end. The template
        contains two repeats of the G-Quadruplex DNAzyme complementary sequences, the annealing sites for the RCA primer
        and the second-generation RCA scaffold, as well as three cutting sites for Nt.BsmAI (figure ES3). The cutting by
        Nt.BsmAI is designed to separate individual G-Quadruplex DNAzyme structures as well as to exponentially amplify
        the RCA primer throughout the RCA process.

        shorter bands visible on lane (1) was possibly due to the ligation of two or more linear single-stranded
        second-generation RCA templates due to the RCA scaffold acting as a splint DNA flanking across two linear RCA
        templates. It is only visible on lane (1) due to a higher amplification rate in the presence of the RCA primer.

        Firstly, due to the false positive result in E1.1 and the assumption that the RCA scaffold in E1.1 was not

        When coupled with the G-Quadruplex DNAzyme assay, the RCA product did not induce a colour change, as shown in
        figure ES10. A control set up with IDT-synthesised G-quadruplex sequences (<a

        We thus found out that DTT is a reducing agent, while the colour change in the G-Quadruplex assay is dependent
        on the oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to TMB+. The presence of DTT in the reaction mixture most likely
        inhibited the oxidation of TMB, preventing any observation of colour change. E2.3 was conducted to troubleshoot
        this issue.

        DTT in the enzymes’ storing buffer, which is also transferred to the RCA reaction mixture. A follow-up

        experiments. However, this result did not prove that the third-generation RCA products generated by both the RCA
