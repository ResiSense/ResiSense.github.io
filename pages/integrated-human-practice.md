Integrated human practice refers to the collaboration with various parties to further our project.  

# Overview

Our team emphasises the connection of our project design with the actual needs of society. In this regard, we interacted with several experts with the aim of inventing a product that provides maximum impact to society and matches the requirements of various stakeholders.  

# Interviews

> ## Probe Vector Selection
> 
> ### Professor Margaret Ip
> ![](/assets/humans/margaret%20ip%20full.jpg)  
> Professor Ip is the Chairperson of the Department of Microbiology at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. She is an expert in Clinical Microbiology and Infection and is a renowned member of various antibiotics-related committees.  
> <span class="--human-card-above"></span>  
>
> In the interview with Prof Margaret Ip, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the current situation of antibiotic resistance in Hong Kong and the corresponding detection methods.  
> 
> #### Current Methods
> Prof Ip explained that the most common way to detect antibiotic resistance genes is through **DNA sequencing with protein analysis**. However, this method is **expensive**, especially in developing countries. It requires a lab expert and a large machine to analyse.  
>
> #### Sensitivity and Stability
> Prof Ip suggested that **DNA is more stable and sensitive** than detecting proteins or toxins produced by bacteria alone. She recommended that we **detect multiple genes** in one test for the sake of sensitivity and accuracy due to the occurrence of multiple genes in bacteria.
>
> #### Implications
> We plan to **detect related DNA to infer antibiotic resistance** in targeted bacteria. Proteins and toxins will be our alternative if the DNA sensing approach does not work in our web lab. As per Prof Ip's emphasis, our point-of-care device should be **cheaper and faster** than DNA sequencing techniques currently used.  

> ## Point-of-care Kit Design
>
> ### Professor Stephen Tsui
> ![](/assets/humans/stephen%20tsui%20full.jpg)  
> Professor Tsui is a renowned expert in the field of Biomedical Sciences and the director of the Hong Kong Bioinformatics Centre and the Centre for Microbial Genomics and Proteomics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).  
> <span class="--human-card-above"></span>
>
> In the interview with Prof Tsui, we discussed the feasibility and efficiency of our point-of-care (POC) kit and analysed the current market.
>
> #### Specificity and Accuracy
> Prof Tsui pointed out that impurities could lead to significant problems in the accuracy and sensitivity of our RCA step. He suggested that we implement **purification steps** and **controls** in our test to improve the reliability of the results.
>
> #### Targeted Group
> Prof Tsui suggested that our project design tends to be qualitative, rather than quantitative, like MIC. He explained that **a qualitative approach might not be ideal for clinical use**, as doctors may be unable to determine the result and take appropriate actions based on it. Therefore, he recommended that we decide on how to show the colorimetric result in the last step, such as using a laptop with the POC device to **detect the color change quantitatively**, or employ a COVID RAT-like approach.
>
> #### Market
> Prof Tsui pointed out that the most popular and mature approaches to detect antibiotic-resistant genes nowadays in developed countries include MIC, DNA sequencing, and real-time PCR plus single-point mutation enzymes. However, these techniques are not common in developing countries, which means we could be more competitive if we target them.
>
> #### Implications
> Prof Tsui's advice will help us improve the **reliability and accuracy** of our POC kit. We will consider his suggestions on **employing a qualitative approach** and **focusing on a target group** to make our product more competitive in the market.

> ## Antibiotic Use in Hospitals and Public Awareness
>
> ### Dr Pierre Chan
> ![](/assets/humans/pierre%20chan%20full.jpg)  
> Dr Pierre Chan is a medical practitioner and a former legislative counsellor seated as the representative for the medical functional constituency in Hong Kong.  
> <span class="--human-card-above"></span>
>
> In our discussion with Dr Chan, we gained insights into the use of antibiotics in hospitals and public awareness of antibiotics.
>
> #### Hospital Procedure
> Dr Chan explained that in severe cases, doctors usually use **empirical antibiotics** based on international guidelines to save lives instead of finding the most appropriate drugs. However, in non-severe cases, doctors check the type of bacteria involved in the infection. He also mentioned that several samples such as urine, blood, and stool are collected from patients, but only 2-3 samples usually show positive results. **It is crucial to consider the type of samples collected for analysis.** Furthermore, **hospitals usually do not recheck the results due to time and manpower constraints**, and **a full analysis takes 1-2 days**.  
>
> #### Public Awareness
> Dr Chan believes that the problem of antibiotic resistance is more **prevalent in the community** than in hospitals. He cited the misuse of antibiotics in the agricultural industry as an example of how **the abuse of these drugs is not regulated**. Although public awareness about antibiotics is not low in Hong Kong, Dr Chan pointed out that **some people buy restricted drugs, including antibiotics, without a doctor's prescription**. Our discussion highlighted the need for educational events to address this issue. It is essential to consider different approaches to education to ensure that the public is well-informed about the importance of responsible use of antibiotics.
>
> #### Implications
> Our discussion with Dr Chan shed light on the **use of antibiotics in hospitals** and the **public awareness about antibiotics**. We will focus our point-of-care kit for screening speed. We will also consider his insights while developing our educational events to ensure that the public is well-informed about the importance of responsible use of antibiotics.
