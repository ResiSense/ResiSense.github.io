Integrated human practice refers to the collaboration with various parties to further our project.  

# Overview

Our team emphasises the connection of our project design with the actual needs of society. In this regard, we interacted with several experts with the aim of inventing a product that provides maximum impact to society and matches the requirements of various stakeholders.

> Professor Ip is the Chairperson of the Department of Microbiology at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. She is an expert in Clinical Microbiology and Infection and is a renowned member of various antibiotics-related committees.

>
> During an interview with Prof. Margaret Ip, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the current situation of antibiotic resistance in Hong Kong and the corresponding detection methods.  
> 
> #### Current Methods
> Prof Ip explained that the most common way to detect antibiotic resistance genes is through **DNA sequencing with protein analysis**. However, this method is **expensive**, especially in developing countries. It requires a lab expert and a large machine to analyse.  
>
> #### Sensitivity and Stability
> Prof Ip suggested that **DNA is more stable and sensitive** than detecting proteins or toxins produced by bacteria alone. She recommended that we **detect multiple genes** in one test for the sake of sensitivity and accuracy due to the occurrence of multiple genes in bacteria.
>
> #### Implications
> We plan to **detect related DNA to infer antibiotic resistance** in targeted bacteria. Proteins and toxins will be our alternative if the DNA sensing approach does not work in our web lab. As per Prof Ip's emphasis, our point-of-care device should be **cheaper and faster** than DNA sequencing techniques currently used.
