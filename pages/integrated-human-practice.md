Integrated human practice refers to the collaboration with various parties to further our project.  

# Overview

Our team emphasises the connection of our project design with the actual needs of society. In this regard, we interacted with several experts with the aim of inventing a product that provides maximum impact to society and matches the requirements of various stakeholders.

> During an interview with Prof. Margaret Ip, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the current situation of antibiotic resistance in Hong Kong and the corresponding detection methods. We discussed the various genome analysis methods being used in hospitals and the challenges faced by frontline doctors. DNA sequencing with protein analysis is the most common way to detect antibiotic resistance genes, but it is expensive, especially in developing countries. It requires a lab expert and a large machine to analyse. We also discussed the sensitivity and stability of the detecting targets, and Prof. Ip suggested that DNA is more stable and sensitive than detecting proteins or toxins produced by bacteria alone. We received positive feedback from Prof. Ip regarding our project to detect antibiotic-resistant genes with a point-of-care device. She suggested that we detect multiple genes in one test for the sake of sensitivity and accuracy due to the occurrence of multiple genes in bacteria. Moreover, she emphasised that our point-of-care device should be cheaper and faster than DNA sequencing techniques currently used.
